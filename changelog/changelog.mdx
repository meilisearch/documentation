<Update label="v1.29" description="2025-12-08">

## New Features

### Enhanced Settings Indexer
The new settings indexer now supports `searchableAttributes` and `exactAttributes`, allowing for better scalability and near-instant cancellations during indexing operations. This change means that if you modify any combination of the following settings, the new indexer will be used:
- `searchableAttributes`
- `exactAttributes`
- `proximityPrecision`
- `embedders`

To disable the new settings indexer, OSS users can set the `MEILI_EXPERIMENTAL_NO_EDITION_2024_FOR_SETTINGS` environment variable to `true`.

### Default Vector Store for New Indexes
From this version onward, any newly created index will use the new vector store backend by default, which offers improved performance and relevancy. Existing indexes will remain unchanged, but you can still choose the vector store backend explicitly.

### Support for More Models in `huggingFace` Embedder
You can now utilize models with the XLM Roberta architecture when generating embeddings locally on CPU or GPU using the `huggingFace` embedder.

## Improvements

### Build Compatibility Note
The `git` binary is now required at build time to populate the `commitSha1` field of the `/version` endpoint. This change was implemented to enhance build performance.

## Other

### Asset Availability Note
The Meilisearch binary is currently unavailable for `meilisearch-enterprise-macos-amd64` and `meilisearch-macos-amd64` due to a compilation oversight. However, the `meilisearch-enterprise-macos-apple-silicon` and `meilisearch-macos-apple-silicon` binaries are available.

</Update>

<Update label="v1.28" description="2025-12-01">

## Improvements

### Enhanced Language Support
The release introduces an improved word segmentation for Thai, Khmer, and German languages through the integration of Charabia v0.9.9. This enhancement allows for better handling of text in these languages, improving search accuracy and user experience.

### Batch Progress Traces
The metrics route now exposes batch progress traces, which enhances the indexing debugging experience. This allows users to monitor the progress of their indexing tasks more effectively.

## Other

### Prometheus Metrics Route Fix
A bug affecting the Prometheus metrics route in versions 1.28.0 and 1.28.1 has been addressed. Users experiencing high memory usage due to too many tasks should delete all succeeded or failed tasks in the index using the dedicated route or upgrade to at least v1.28.2 to resolve the issue.

### Document Sorting Fix
A fix has been implemented to ensure that documents without the sortable attribute are still returned correctly when sorting on the `/documents` endpoint. This ensures that users receive all relevant documents, regardless of their attributes.

### Separation of Community and Enterprise Editions
The release separates the community and enterprise binary editions. Binaries are now available under the BUSL-1.1 license for the enterprise edition, while the community edition remains under the MIT license. Docker images for the enterprise edition can be found in the `getmeili/meilisearch-enterprise` repository.

</Update>

<Update label="v1.27" description="2025-11-24">

## Improvements

### Enhanced Task Queue Error Reporting
Error messages in the task queue have been improved to provide better debugging information when uploading snapshots to S3. This enhancement will help users quickly identify and resolve issues during the upload process.

### Optimized Batch Size for Task Ingestion
The default total size for batched tasks is now set to half of the maximum indexing memory. This change improves the performance of task ingestion, allowing for more efficient processing of documents.

## Other

### Compatibility Support for macOS
Meilisearch binaries for macOS are now generated with support for macOS Sonoma (`macos-14`). This ensures compatibility with the latest macOS version for users on that platform.

</Update>

<Update label="v1.26" description="2025-11-17">

## New Features

### Custom Metadata for Document Tasks
You can now attach custom metadata to document addition or update tasks, making it easier to track processed documents. This metadata will be displayed when accessing tasks via the tasks route or in webhooks.

To use this feature, add the `customMetadata` query parameter to any supported route:

```http
POST /indexes/{indexUid}/documents?customMetadata=my-metadata-for-the-task
```

Supported routes include:

```text
POST /indexes/{indexUid}/documents
PUT /indexes/{indexUid}/documents
DELETE /indexes/{indexUid}/documents/{documentId}
POST /indexes/{indexUid}/documents/delete-batch
POST /indexes/{indexUid}/documents/delete
POST /indexes/{indexUid}/documents/edit
DELETE /indexes/{indexUid}/documents
```

Sample output of `GET /tasks` for tasks with metadata:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "uid": 37,
      "batchUid": 37,
      "indexUid": "mieli",
      "status": "succeeded",
      "type": "documentDeletion",

    }
  ],
  "total": 38,
  "limit": 2,
  "from": 36,
  "next": 35
}
```

### Support for Modern BERT Models
The `huggingFace` embedder now supports models with the `modernBERT` architecture, allowing you to generate embeddings locally on CPU or GPU. This includes models like Ruri v3 and others.

## Improvements

### Experimental: Embedder Failure Modes
You can now choose to ignore certain embedder-related errors, such as:

1. Document template rendering failures
2. Embedding request failures (including missing vectors in `userProvided` embedders)
3. Both types of errors

When errors are ignored, the corresponding documents will not have embeddings, but the associated batch of tasks will not be marked as failed. To enable this feature, OSS users can set the `MEILI_EXPERIMENTAL_CONFIG_EMBEDDER_FAILURE_MODES` environment variable with the desired error types to ignore:

```text
ignore_document_template_failures,ignore_embedder_failures
```

### Experimental: Timeout Control for REST Embedders
You can now control the timeout duration for REST embedder requests. OSS users can set the `MEILI_EXPERIMENTAL_REST_EMBEDDER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` environment variable to a positive integer to specify the timeout duration.

## Other

### Removal of Unused Dependency
The unused dependency `allocator-api2` has been removed from the project.

</Update>

<Update label="v1.25" description="2025-11-10">

## New Features

### Experimental: Search Personalization
You can now dynamically rerank search results using personalized prompts with Cohere. This feature allows for a more tailored search experience based on user preferences.

### Experimental: Upload Snapshots to S3
Snapshots can now be uploaded directly to S3, enabling efficient streaming and the use of multipart technology to send data chunks in parallel.

## Improvements

### German Word Segmentation Enhancement
The German word segmenter has been improved to skip segmenting unknown words, ensuring that words not in the dictionary are treated as whole units. For example:

```yaml
Source: "Feuchteschutz"
Before: ["Fe", "uc", "ht", "es", "ch", "utz"]
After: ["Feuchteschutz"]
```

### Chinese Text Segmentation Improvement
The segmentation process for Chinese text has been enhanced to prevent the splitting of numbers and English words. For example:

```yaml
Source: "我从2025年开始学习Rust语言。"
Before: ["我", "从", "2", "0", "2", "5", "年", "开始", "学习", "R", "u", "s", "t", "语言", "。"]
After: ["我", "从", "2025", "年", "开始", "学习", "Rust", "语言", "。"]
```

## Other

### Breaking Change: Redaction of Authorization Header
The `Authorization` header value is now redacted in webhooks. This change means that users will no longer receive the key value when retrieving webhooks, enhancing security. Ensure that your UI does not send the `Authorization` header back after it has been redacted.

</Update>

<Update label="v1.24" description="2025-10-20">

## New Features

### Metadata Header for Search Requests
You can now include a metadata header `Meili-Include-Metadata` in your search requests. This will add a metadata field to the response, which contains a unique identifier (`uid`) for each query, along with a reminder of the `indexUid` and its primary key.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Vector Store Search Cutoff
The interaction between the vector store and the `searchCutoffMs` setting has been improved when using the `"vectorStore": "experimental"` index setting. This enhancement allows for more efficient searches.

### Improved Compaction Behavior
The behavior of compaction has been enhanced, leading to better performance and interaction with task cancellation.

## Other

### Minor Bug Fixes
This release includes minor bug fixes related to compaction, which improve the overall stability and performance of the system.

</Update>

<Update label="v1.23" description="2025-10-13">

## New Features

### Index Compaction Task
A new compact route has been introduced for indexes, allowing you to append a compaction task to the queue. This helps reduce fragmentation in the LMDB environment used by Meilisearch, which can lead to significant performance improvements in search and indexing speeds.

To compact an index, you can use the following endpoint:

```http
POST /indexes/{indexUid}/compact
```

This operation can lead to speed-ups of 2-4x by reorganizing internal pages and removing scattered free pages.

## Improvements

### Parallel Processing of Facets
The post-processing of facets has been parallelized, significantly reducing the time spent on this operation. This change allows for multi-threaded processing, resulting in improvements of 4x to 6x in performance.

### Request UID in Search Routes
A request UID has been added to search routes, allowing for better tracking and management of search requests.

## Other

### Deprecation of Release Drafter

## New Features

### Configurable Remote Search Timeout
The remote federated search timeout can now be configured. Set the environment variable `MEILI_EXPERIMENTAL_REMOTE_SEARCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to a positive integer value to adjust the timeout duration for waiting nodes.

## Improvements

### Geo Backend for GeoJSON
A new geo backend has been introduced to store GeoJSON data and filter on polygons. You can now:
1. Make the `_geojson` field filterable.
2. Send your documents with a `_geojson` field filled with valid GeoJSON.
3. Filter your documents using the new `_geoPolygon` filter, along with the existing `_geoBoundingBox` and `_geoPoints` filters.

## Other

### Migration Note for Remote Federated Search Users
If you are using remote federated search, please note that migrating from v1.22.x is necessary due to the changes in timeout configuration. If you are not a remote federated search user, no migration is required.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Hybrid Search with Filters
The performance of hybrid searches combined with filters has been significantly improved. Previously, using filters could drastically increase search times. Now, Meilisearch computes the semantic distance directly with filtered candidates when only a few candidates are returned from the filter, leading to faster search results.

Example of a hybrid search with a filter:

```json
{
  "q": "hello world",
  "limit": 100,
  "filter": "tag=science",
  "hybrid": {
    "semanticRatio": 0.5,
    "embedder": "default"
  }
}
```

## New Features

### AI-Powered Search Integration
AI-powered search is now available by default for all users, enhancing search capabilities without requiring manual activation.

### Experimental Feature: Dumpless Upgrades
You can now upgrade to new Meilisearch releases without generating a dump. Use the following command after updating the Meilisearch binary:

```bash
./meilisearch --experimental-dumpless-upgrade
```

This process is faster and more efficient, but it is recommended to create a backup snapshot before migrating.

### Experimental Feature: Remote Federated Search Requests
You can perform remote federated search requests across multiple Meilisearch instances. First, enable the `network` feature:

```bash
curl \
 -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/experimental-features/' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{
 "network": true
 }'
```

Then, configure your network of instances:

```bash
curl \
 -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/network/' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{
 "remotes": {
 "ms-0": {
 "url": "http://ms-1235.example.meilisearch.io",
 "searchApiKey": "Ecd1SDDi4pqdJD6qYLxD3y7VZAEb4d9j6LJgt4d6xas"
 },
 "ms-1": {
 "url": "http://ms-4242.example.meilisearch.io",
 "searchApiKey": "hrVu-OMcjPGElK7692K7bwriBoGyHXTMvB5NmZkMKqQ"
 }
 },
 "self": "ms-0"
 }'
```

Finally, make a `/multi-search` query:

```bash
curl \
 -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/multi-search/' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{
 "federation": {},
 "queries": [
 {
 "q": "Batman returns dark",
 "indexUid": "movies",
 "federationOptions": {
 "remote": "ms-0"
 }
 },
 {
 "q": "Batman returns dark",
 "indexUid": "movies",
 "federationOptions": {
 "remote": "ms-1"
 }
 }
 ]
}'
```

## Improvements

### New `usedDatabaseSize` Field
A new `usedDatabaseSize` field is now available on the `/stats` route, providing more information about database usage.

### Embeddings Info on `/stats` Route
The `/stats` route now exposes information about embeddings, enhancing monitoring capabilities.

## Other

### Breaking Changes
- The `vectorStore` value is no longer accepted for the `/experimental-features` route.
- Ollama URLs must now end with either `/api/embed` or `/api/embeddings`.
- Error codes have been modified:
 - `invalid_embedder` is now split into `invalid_search_embedder` and `invalid_similar_embedder`.
 - `invalid_hybrid_query` has been renamed to `invalid_search_hybrid_query`.

</Update>

<Update label="v1.12" description="2024-12-23">

## New Features

### Improved Indexing Speed
Meilisearch v1.12 introduces significant improvements in indexing speed, reducing the time required to index large datasets. This enhancement is particularly noticeable on larger machines with multiple cores, where indexing can be more than twice as fast for raw document insertion tasks and over four times faster for incremental updates.

### New Index Settings: `facetSearch` and `prefixSearch`
Two new settings have been added to optimize indexing speed:

- **`facetSearch`**: This setting allows you to enable or disable facet search for filterable attributes. By default, it is set to `true`.
 
 ```bash
 curl \
 -X PUT 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/books/settings/facet-search' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary 'true'
 ```

- **`prefixSearch`**: This setting controls the ability to search for words by their prefixes. It can be set to `"indexingTime"` (default) or `"disabled"`.

 ```bash
 curl \
 -X PUT 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/books/settings/prefix-search' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary 'disabled'
 ```

### New API Route: `/batches`
A new endpoint `/batches` has been introduced to query information about task batches. You can retrieve a list of batches or details about a specific batch.

- To get a list of batches:

 ```bash
 curl -X GET 'http://localhost:7700/batches'
 ```

- To get details about a specific batch:

 ```bash
 curl -X GET 'http://localhost:7700/batches/BATCH_UID'
 ```

Batch objects now include a `batchUid` field, which can be used to correlate tasks with their respective batches.

## Improvements

### Max Readers Parameter
You can now set the maximum number of readers through an environment variable, which helps in optimizing resource usage.

### Enhanced Task Management
The indexing process has been improved to prevent issues such as infinite loops and failures when attempting to delete non-existent keys. This results in a more reliable indexing experience.

### Improved Error Messages
Error messages have been enhanced to provide more context, including the index name, making it easier to diagnose issues.

## Other

### Breaking Change: `vectorStore`
The field distribution in `vectorStore` no longer contains `_vectors`. This change was made to correct an incorrect value and streamline the data structure, as there was no current use case for the previously included value.

</Update>

## New Features

### AI-Powered Search Improvements
This release introduces significant enhancements to AI-powered search, marking the first step towards stabilization. Key changes include:

- The `hybrid.embedder` parameter is now mandatory for both `GET` and `POST` requests to `/indexes/{:indexUid}/search`.
- The `embedder` parameter is also mandatory for `GET` and `POST` requests to `/indexes/{:indexUid}/similar`.
- The default model for OpenAI has been updated to `text-embedding-3-small`.

### Federated Search Enhancements
New options for federated searches have been added:

- `facetsByIndex`: Request facet distributions and stats for each index.
- `mergeFacets`: Merge facet distributions and stats across all indexes.

Example request for facet information by index:

```json
POST /multi-search
{
 "federation": {
 "limit": 20,
 "offset": 0,
 "facetsByIndex": {
 "movies": ["title", "id"],
 "comics": ["title"]
 }
 },
 "queries": [
 {
 "q": "Batman",
 "indexUid": "movies"
 },
 {
 "q": "Batman",
 "indexUid": "comics"
 }
 ]
}
```

### Experimental `STARTS WITH` Filter Operator
An experimental feature allows the use of the `STARTS WITH` filter operator. Enable it with:

```bash
curl \
 -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{
 "containsFilter": true
 }'
```

You can then use it in search queries:

```json
curl \
 -X POST http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/search \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{
 "filter": "hero STARTS WITH spider"
 }'
```

## Improvements

### Timeout Settings for Operations
Timeouts have been added for read and write operations, enhancing reliability during data processing.

### Enhanced Embedding Request Timeout
A 3-second timeout has been introduced for embedding requests made during searches, improving overall search performance.

### Vector Database Indexing Performance
The new `binaryQuantized` option can be enabled to improve performance in large collections. This converts embeddings of floating point numbers into boolean values, significantly reducing database size and indexing time:

```bash
curl \
 -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{
 "embedders": {
 "image2text": {
 "binaryQuantized": true
 }
 }
 }'
```

## Other

### Breaking Changes
- The `hybrid.embedder` and `embedder` parameters are now mandatory for specific search and similarity requests.
- The `semanticRatio` parameter is ignored if a query includes `vector` but not `q`, resulting in a pure semantic search.

### Deprecations
- The previous default document template will continue to work with existing embedders, but new embedders will use the updated template that filters out empty fields and non-searchable attributes.

</Update>

<Update label="v1.10" description="2024-08-26">

```bash
curl \
 -X PUT 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/articles/settings/separator-tokens' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '["&sect;", "&sep"]'
```

To add characters to the `nonSeparatorTokens` list:

```bash
curl \
 -X PUT 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/articles/settings/non-separator-tokens' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '["@", "#", "&"]'
```

### Load User-Defined Dictionaries
You can now enhance word segmentation accuracy by using the `dictionary` index setting to include domain-specific terms.

To add custom terms to the dictionary:

```bash
curl \
 -X PUT 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/articles/settings/dictionary' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '["J. R. R.", "J.R.R."]'
```

You can also combine this with `stopWords` and `synonyms` settings:

```json
{
  "dictionary": [
    "J. R. R.",
    "J.R.R."
  ],
  "synonyms": {
    "J.R.R.": [
      "jrr",
      "J. R. R."
    ],
    "J. R. R.": [
      "jrr",
      "J.R.R."
    ],
    "jrr": [
      "J.R.R.",
      "J. R. R."
    ]
  }
}
```

## Improvements

### Enhanced Error Messages for Hidden Fields
Meilisearch now provides clearer error messages when attempting to sort by non-sortable fields. Hidden fields will not be displayed, and you will see a message like:

```
Available sortable attributes are: price, stock, <..hidden-attributes>.

### Breaking Change for `filter` Parameter
A significant change has been made regarding the use of `\` characters in the `filter` search parameter. Users must now escape all `\` characters in their filter expressions.

For example, to filter on a document with a path containing backslashes, you must now use:

```text
path = "my\\\\test\\\\path\\\\"
```

This change allows for more accurate filtering but requires adjustments for users who previously used backslashes in their filters. If you need assistance with this change, please reach out for support.

```

### Define Fields to Search on at Search Time
Use the `attributesToSearchOn` parameter to restrict searches to specific document attributes.

```json
{
  "q": "adventure",
  "attributesToSearchOn": [
    "genre"
  ]
}
```

### Search for Facet Values
The new endpoint `POST /indexes/{index}/facet-search` allows you to search for facet values.

```bash
curl \
 -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/facet-search' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{
 "facetName": "genres",
 "facetQuery": "a"
 }'
```

### Sort Facet Values by Count

</Update>

<Update label="v1.2" description="2023-06-05">

## New Features

### Delete Documents by Filter
You can now delete documents using filters with the new `/documents/delete` route. This allows for more precise document management.

Example usage:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7700/indexes/dogs/documents/delete \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{ "filter": ["doggo = \'bernese mountain\'", "face = cute"] }'
```

The response will include a summarized task object:

```json
{
  "taskUid": 242,
  "indexUid": "dogs",
  "status": "enqueued",
  "type": "documentDeletion",
  "enqueuedAt": "2023-05-03T11:01:58.721841Z"
}
```

### Get Documents by Filter
You can now retrieve documents using filters in the `GET` endpoint of the `/documents` route:

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/dogs/documents?limit=1&filter=doggo=bernese'
```

Additionally, the new `/documents/fetch` route allows for more complex filtering:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7700/indexes/dogs/documents/fetch \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{ "limit": 1, "filter": "doggo = bernese" }'
```

### New Filter Operators: `IS EMPTY` and `IS NULL`
Two new filter operators have been introduced: `IS EMPTY` and `IS NULL`. These operators allow for more nuanced queries.

Example documents:

```json
[
 {
 "id": 0,
 "color": 
 },
 {
 "id": 1,
 "color": null
 },
 {
 "id": 2
 }
]
```

- `color IS EMPTY` matches document `0`.
- `color IS NULL` matches document `1`.

### Automated Task Deletion
The maximum number of tasks in the task queue is now limited to 1 million. When this limit is reached, Meilisearch will attempt to delete the oldest tasks to make room for new ones.

## Improvements

 },
 {
 "indexUid": "brands",
 "hits": […],
 "query": "Nike",
 "processingTimeMs": 0,
 "limit": 1,
 "offset": 0,
 "estimatedTotalHits": 7
 }
 ]
}
```

### Introduce `facetStats`
Queries that include the `facets` parameter now return a `facetStats` object by default, providing statistical information about numerical facets.

Example request:

```bash
curl \
 -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/search' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{
 "facets": ["price"]

```json
{
 "hits": […],
 "facetDistribution": {
 "price": {…}
 },
 "facetStats": {
 "price": {
 "min": 2,
 "max": 60
 }
 }
}
```

### New Geosearch Filter: `_geoBoundingBox`
You can now filter search results based on geographic boundaries using the `_geoBoundingBox` filter.

Example request:

```bash
curl \
 -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/restaurants/search' \
 -H 'Content-type:application/json' \
 --data-binary '{ "filter": "_geoBoundingBox([45.472735, 9.184019],[45.473711, 9.185613] )" }'
```

### Unlimited Index Size and Count
Meilisearch now allows you to create an unlimited number of indexes, with size limits dictated only by your operating system's memory address space.

### Revamped Primary Key Inference
The primary key inference process has been improved. If an index's primary key is not specified, Meilisearch will attempt to infer it from attributes ending with `id`. If multiple candidates are found, you will be prompted to specify the primary key.

### Changes to Error Handling
All detailed task responses now include an `error` field with a JSON-formatted error response containing an error `code` and `type`. Many of these codes and types have been updated to improve clarity and user experience.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.30" description="2022-11-28">

## New Features

### Improved Search Result Navigation
You can now paginate search results more effectively with the new parameters `page` and `hitsPerPage`. This allows you to retrieve an exact count of `totalHits` and `totalPages`, making it easier to create user-friendly pagination interfaces.

Example request to fetch the second page of results:

```bash
curl \
 -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/search' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{ "q": "shifu", "page": "2", "hitsPerPage": "10" }'
```

Example response:

```json
{
 "hits": [
 // … 10 hits
 ],
 "page": 2,
 "hitsPerPage": 10,
 "totalHits": 2100,
 "totalPages": 210
}
```

### Task Cancellation
You can now cancel `enqueued` or `processing` tasks using the new API route `/tasks/cancel`. This is useful for interrupting tasks that are taking too long or were enqueued by mistake.

Example to cancel tasks by `uid`:

```bash
curl \
 -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/tasks/cancel?uids=1,2'
```

### Delete Task History
A new `DELETE` endpoint has been introduced to the `/tasks` route, allowing you to remove finished tasks from the task history. This helps in managing disk space.

Example to delete tasks by `uid`:

```bash
curl \
 -X DELETE 'http://localhost:7700/tasks?uids=1,2'
```

### Zero Downtime Index Deployment
You can now deploy new versions of indexes without downtime using the `/swap-indexes` API. This allows for seamless updates to your search clients.

Example to swap indexes:

```bash
curl \
 -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/swap-indexes' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '[{ "indexes": ["indexA", "indexB"] }]'
```

### Configuration File Support
You can now use a configuration file to set instance options. By default, Meilisearch looks for a file named `./config.toml`.

Example command to specify a custom config file:

```bash
meilisearch --config-file-path="./my-config.toml"
```

Example configuration file:

```toml
env = "production"
master_key = "MY_MASTER_KEY"
schedule_snapshot = true
```

## Improvements

### Enhanced Filters for Tasks
New filters are available for the `GET /tasks` endpoint, including `uids`, `canceledBy`, and date filters.

### Compressed API Requests
Full support for compressed API requests (Gzip, Brotli, Zlib) has been added, improving data transfer efficiency.

### Indexing Speed Improvements
Significant improvements have been made to indexing speed, enhancing performance when adding or updating documents.

### Default Bind Address Change
The default bind address has been changed from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost`, making it accessible in both IPv4 and IPv6.

### Increased Max Concurrent Readers
The maximum number of concurrent readers has been increased from 126 to 1024, allowing for better handling of simultaneous requests.

## Other

### Behavior Changes
- The `receivedDocumentIds` field in the task object has been renamed to `providedIds` during the `delete-batch` action.
- A new error `missing_master_key` will be returned when using `/keys` without a master key set, replacing the previous `invalid_api_key` error.
- Some filter parameter names for `/tasks` have been renamed for clarity, including `indexUid` to `indexUids` and `status` to `statuses`.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.29" description="2022-10-03">

## New Features

### Customize Matching Strategy
You can now control how Meilisearch matches documents during search by requiring all query terms to be present in the results. This feature allows for more precise search results.

To activate this feature, use the following request:

```bash
curl \
 -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/search' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{ "q": "american ninja", "matchingStrategy": "all" }'
```

By setting `"matchingStrategy": "all"`, Meilisearch will only return documents containing both "american" and "ninja".

### Thai Language Support
Meilisearch now offers optimized support for the Thai language, enhancing search capabilities for Thai text.

### Filtering: Introduce `EXISTS` and `IN` Operators
You can now use the `EXISTS` and `IN` operators with the `filter` search parameter. For example, given the following documents:

```json
{ "id": 1, "product": "T-shirt", "price": 20, "color": "yellow" }
{ "id": 2, "product": "T-shirt", "color": "red" }
{ "id": 3, "product": "T-shirt", "price": 30 }
{ "id": 4, "product": "T-shirt", "price": 40 }
```

- The filter `price EXISTS` will select documents `1`, `3`, and `4`.
- The filter `price IN [30, 20]` will select documents `1` and `3`.

### Key Management Enhancements
When managing keys, you can now use the `*` helper to express a set of actions in the `actions` array. For example, instead of specifying each action individually, you can use `indexes.*`.

## Improvements

### Performance Improvements for Indexing
Indexing speed has been improved, especially for indexes using `filterableAttributes` and during document updates and deletions.

### Auto-Batching Enabled by Default
The previously experimental auto-batching feature is now enabled by default, which should enhance indexing speed. If you had previously enabled auto-batching, you can remove the `--enable-auto-batching` flag.

## Other

### Database Corruption Warning
If you encounter issues after upgrading to this version, it may indicate that your database is corrupted. The only way to recover your data is to re-upload your documents to a fresh index, as using a dump will not work.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.28" description="2022-07-11">

## New Features

### Smart Crop
The smart crop feature enhances the existing cropping algorithm by identifying the window(s) with the highest density of query terms within the specified `cropLength`. This allows for more relevant snippets to be returned in search results.

### API Key Management: Deterministic Keys
You can now create deterministic API keys by specifying a `uid` field during creation. The `key` is generated by hashing the master key and the `uid`:

```bash
echo -n $HYPHENATED_UUID | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac $MASTER_KEY
```

This ensures that `key` values are consistent across instances with the same configuration. Additionally, a `name` field has been added for easier key retrieval, and new actions for managing API keys have been introduced.

### Hebrew Language Support
Support for the Hebrew language has been added, utilizing the Niqqud library for improved text processing.

### Improved Tokenizer Contribution Experience
The process for contributing new languages to the Meilisearch tokenizer has been significantly enhanced. Users can now follow a clear guide to integrate their language's normalizer/segmenter.

### Customizable Limits for Facet Values
You can now customize the maximum number of facet values returned per attribute. The default limit is 100, but it can be increased using the `faceting` setting:

```bash
curl \
 -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/books/settings/faceting' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{
 "maxValuesPerFacet": 3000
 }'
```

### Customizable Limits for Documents Returned by Search
The maximum number of documents returned by a search can now be customized. The default limit is 1000, which can be increased using the `pagination` setting:

```bash
curl \
 -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/books/settings/pagination' \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-binary '{
 "maxTotalHits": 2000
 }'
```

## Improvements

### Changes in `/indexes/{uid}/search` Endpoint
Several parameters in the search endpoint have been renamed for clarity:
- `nbHits` is now `estimatedTotalHits`
- `facetsDistribution` is now `facets`
- `matches` is now `showMatchesPosition`

### Pagination Improvements
The response for getting the index list and documents list now includes pagination details, allowing users to navigate through results more easily.

### Enhanced Task Filtering
The `GET /tasks` endpoint now supports filtering by `type`, `status`, and `indexUid`, making it easier to manage tasks.

### Changes in `/keys` Endpoint
The `apiKeyPrefix` has been renamed to `apiKeyUid`, and the response for getting the keys list is now paginated.

## Other

### Breaking Changes
- The `facetsDistribution` field in the response body has been renamed to `facetDistribution`.
- The `GET /indexes` endpoint now returns a paginated response.
- The `GET /indexes/{uid}/documents` endpoint has updated parameter names and pagination improvements.
- The `GET /indexes/:indexUid/tasks` endpoint has been removed; use `GET /tasks?indexUid=:indexUid` instead.
- The `dumps.get` action has been removed from the `/keys` endpoint.

These changes aim to stabilize the Meilisearch API and improve the overall user experience.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.27" description="2022-05-09">

## New Features

### Nested Field Support
Meilisearch now fully supports nested document fields, allowing you to use nested fields in any API parameter that accepts document attributes using dot notation. For example, when setting your `filterableAttributes`:

```json
{
  "filterableAttributes": [
    "person.firstname"
  ]
}
```

You can filter during the search like this:

```json
{
  "filter": "person.firstname = Gui"
}
```

### Customize Typo Tolerance
You can now customize the typo tolerance settings through new API endpoints. The `typoTolerance` object includes:

- `enabled`: Whether the typo tolerance feature is enabled (default: `true`).
- `disableOnAttributes`: Disable typo tolerance on specified document attributes (default: ``).
- `disableOnWords`: Disable typo tolerance for specific query terms (default: ``).
- `minWordSizeForTypos`: Customize minimum sizes for words to tolerate typos:
 - `oneTypo`: Minimum size for a word to tolerate 1 typo (default: `5`).
 - `twoTypos`: Minimum size for a word to tolerate 2 typos (default: `9`).

### Improved Cropping and Highlighting
You can now customize the tags used for highlighting query terms and the crop markers for long field values:

- `highlightPreTag`: Tag before highlighted query terms (default: `<em>`).
- `highlightPostTag`: Tag after highlighted query terms (default: `</em>`).
- `cropMarker`: Marker around cropped field values (default: `...`).

### Japanese Language Support
New language support for Japanese has been added via the Lindera tokenizer, enhancing the multilingual capabilities of Meilisearch.

### New Instance Options
New options for limiting RAM and CPU usage during indexing have been introduced:

- `--max-indexing-memory` (`MEILI_MAX_INDEXING_MEMORY`): Sets the maximum RAM size during indexing.

## Improvements

### Enhanced Indexation Performance
Indexation time has been improved when inserting documents, making the process faster and more efficient.

### Better Error Messages
Error messages for `sortableAttributes` and `filterableAttributes` during search have been improved for better clarity.

## Other

### Breaking Changes
- The `cropLength` parameter now specifies a number of words instead of characters, stabilizing and improving cropping behavior.
- Typo tolerance behavior has changed: a typo on the first letter now counts as 2 typos, which optimizes search performance.
- A hard limit of `1000` retrievable documents during search has been implemented to enhance security and prevent scraping. This limit does not apply to the `GET /indexes/:uid/documents` route.
- Docker now launches from a different working directory, requiring you to mount your volume in `/meili_data`. Use the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
 -p 7700:7700 \
 -v $(pwd)/meili_data:/meili_data \
 getmeili/meilisearch:latest
```

- The `meilisearch` binary has been relocated, and you can now call it using `meilisearch`, `/meilisearch`, or `/bin/meilisearch`. The following command is correct:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 7700:7700 getmeili/meilisearch:latest meilisearch --no-analytics
``` 

Using `./meilisearch` is incorrect.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.26" description="2022-03-14">

## New Features

### Tenant Tokens
You can now use tenant tokens to restrict access to documents based on the end-user making the search request. This feature enables multi-tenant indexes, allowing for more secure and tailored search experiences.

A tenant token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) generated by combining an API key with specific permissions and rules for the end user's search.

### Auto-Batching (Experimental)
The new auto-batching feature improves indexing speed by automatically batching consecutive document additions. To enable this feature, run:

```bash
meilisearch --enable-auto-batching

<Update label="v0.24" description="2021-11-16">

## New Features

### Enhanced Error Handling
The error handling system has been improved with new error types and a revised structure. The fields `errorCode`, `errorType`, and `errorLink` have been renamed to `code`, `type`, and `link`. New error types include `invalid_request`, `auth`, and `internal`. Failed updates now return a more informative error object with the fields: `message`, `code`, `type`, and `link`.

### Attributes to Highlight on Numerical Values
The `attributesToHighlight` feature now supports both numerical and string values. The `_formatted` object in the search response will only contain strings, as numerical values are converted to strings. The original document with numerical values remains accessible at the root of the search response.

### Docker User Change
When using the Docker image, MeiliSearch now runs as the `meili` user instead of `root`. Consequently, the path for storing `data.ms` has changed from `/data.ms` to `/home/meili/data.ms`.

 - String: 
 ```json
{
  "filter": "genre = comedy AND price > 13"
}
```
 - Array: 
 ```json
{
  "filter": [
    "genre = comedy",
    "price > 13"
  ]
}
```
- When using the `filter` parameter on an array, the operator `!=` will only return results that do not contain the specified value.
- The default ranking rules have been updated to:
 ```json
[
  "words",
  "typo",
  "proximity",
  "attribute",
  "exactness"
]
```
