Ranking rules are the criteria Meilisearch uses to sort search results by relevance. They determine why one document appears before another in search results.

## How ranking rules work

Meilisearch uses a **bucket sort** algorithm:

1. The first ranking rule sorts all matching documents
2. Documents tied under the first rule are sorted by the second rule
3. This continues until all rules are applied or ties are broken

**Rule order matters.** The first rule has the most impact on results. The last rule only affects documents that tied under all previous rules.

## Default ranking rules

Meilisearch applies these rules in order:

```json
["words", "typo", "proximity", "attribute", "sort", "exactness"]
```

| Rule | Sorts by |
|------|----------|
| **words** | Number of matched query terms (more matches = higher) |
| **typo** | Number of typos (fewer typos = higher) |
| **proximity** | Distance between matched terms (closer = higher) |
| **attribute** | Which field contains the match (based on searchable attributes order) |
| **sort** | User-defined sort parameter at query time |
| **exactness** | How closely matches resemble the query (exact = higher) |

## Example

For query `batman dark knight`:

1. **words**: Documents with all 3 terms rank first, then 2 terms, then 1
2. **typo**: Among documents with equal term matches, fewer typos rank higher
3. **proximity**: Documents where terms appear close together rank higher
4. **attribute**: Matches in `title` rank higher than matches in `description`
5. **exactness**: Exact phrase matches rank higher than partial matches

## Customizing ranking rules

Reorder rules to change relevance behavior:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/indexes/movies/settings/ranking-rules" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '["words", "exactness", "typo", "proximity", "attribute", "sort"]'
```

### Custom ranking rules

Add business-specific sorting with custom rules:

```json
["words", "typo", "proximity", "attribute", "sort", "exactness", "rating:desc", "popularity:desc"]
```

Custom rules use the format `attribute:asc` or `attribute:desc`.

## Common customizations

| Goal | Configuration |
|------|---------------|
| Prioritize exact matches | Move `exactness` higher |
| Boost popular items | Add `popularity:desc` |
| Prefer newer content | Add `date:desc` |
| De-emphasize typos | Move `typo` lower or remove it |
