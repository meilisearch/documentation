description: Hybrid search combines keyword-based and semantic search to deliver results that are both precise and contextually relevant.

Hybrid search combines keyword-based retrieval with semantic search to deliver results that match both exact terms and contextual meaning. This approach gives users the best of both worlds: precise matches when they use specific terms and relevant results when they describe what they're looking for in natural language.

## How hybrid search works

Hybrid search uses two complementary retrieval methods:

1. **Keyword search** uses sparse vectors to find exact term matches. When you search for "iPhone 15 case," keyword search finds documents containing those exact words.

2. **Semantic search** uses dense vector embeddings to understand meaning. A search for "phone protection" returns results about cases and covers, even without those exact words.

The system retrieves results from both methods, then combines and ranks them based on relevance. You can adjust the balance between keyword and semantic results using a **semantic ratio**.

## Semantic ratio

The semantic ratio controls how much weight Meilisearch gives to semantic versus keyword results:

| Ratio | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `0.0` | Pure keyword search |
| `0.5` | Equal weight to both |
| `1.0` | Pure semantic search |

For most applications, a ratio between `0.5` and `0.8` works well, favoring semantic understanding while preserving keyword precision.

## Example

```json
POST /indexes/products/search
{
  "q": "comfortable shoes for walking all day",
  "hybrid": {
    "semanticRatio": 0.7,
    "embedder": "default"
  }
}
```

This query uses 70% semantic search and 30% keyword search. It will find products described as comfortable walking shoes, but also orthopedic footwear and cushioned sneakers that match the intent.

## When to use hybrid search

Hybrid search is ideal when:

- Users may not know exact product names or terminology
- Your content uses varied vocabulary for similar concepts
- You want natural language queries to return relevant results
- Precision matters for specific searches (model numbers, codes)
