Semantic search is a search method that understands the meaning and intent behind a query rather than simply matching keywords. It bridges the gap between how humans think and how machines process language, delivering more relevant results for natural language queries.

## Semantic vs keyword search

| Aspect | Keyword search | Semantic search |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Matching** | Exact words | Meaning and intent |
| **Query handling** | Literal interpretation | Contextual understanding |
| **"Running shoes"** | Documents with "running" and "shoes" | Jogging sneakers, athletic footwear |
| **Typos/synonyms** | Often fails | Handles naturally |

## How semantic search works

1. **Query analysis**: Natural language processing breaks down the query to understand entities, intent, and context.

2. **Embedding generation**: The query is converted into a [vector embedding](/getting_started/glossary/vector_embeddings) that captures its meaning.

3. **Similarity matching**: The system finds documents with embeddings closest to the query embedding using [vector search](/getting_started/glossary/vector_search).

4. **Ranking**: Results are ordered by semantic relevance, with optional re-ranking based on additional signals.

## Example

A search for "affordable laptops for students" using semantic search understands:
- **Intent**: Finding budget-friendly computers
- **Context**: Educational use, likely basic tasks
- **Related concepts**: Chromebooks, budget notebooks, student discounts

The results include relevant products even if they don't contain the exact words "affordable," "laptop," or "student."

## Semantic search in Meilisearch

Meilisearch implements semantic search through its [AI-powered search](/products/hybrid_search/getting_started) features. When you configure an embedder, Meilisearch can:

- Understand natural language queries
- Find conceptually related content
- Return relevant results for vague or exploratory searches

For best results, combine semantic search with keyword search using [hybrid search](/getting_started/glossary/hybrid_search):

```json
POST /indexes/products/search
{
  "q": "comfortable office chair for long hours",
  "hybrid": {
    "semanticRatio": 0.7,
    "embedder": "default"
  }
}
```

## When to use semantic search

Semantic search excels when:

- Users describe what they want in natural language
- Your content uses varied vocabulary for similar concepts
- Exact terminology isn't known to users
- You want to improve discovery and exploration

Keyword search remains better for:

- Exact matches (product codes, IDs, technical terms)
- Users who know precisely what they're looking for
- Structured data queries
