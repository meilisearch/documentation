Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data (text, images, or other content) that capture semantic meaning in a format computers can process. They are the foundation of [vector search](/getting_started/glossary/vector_search) and [AI-powered search](/products/hybrid_search/getting_started).

## What embeddings look like

An embedding is an array of floating-point numbers, typically with hundreds or thousands of dimensions:

```json
[0.0231, -0.0412, 0.1893, 0.0012, -0.0891, ...]
```

Each dimension captures some aspect of the content's meaning. Similar items have similar embeddings, meaning they are close together in the vector space.

## How embeddings capture meaning

Machine learning models learn to create embeddings by analyzing patterns in large datasets. For text, this means understanding:

- **Semantic similarity**: "car" and "automobile" get similar embeddings
- **Relationships**: "king" - "man" + "woman" ≈ "queen"
- **Context**: "bank" in "river bank" vs "bank account" gets different embeddings

## Types of embeddings

| Type | Created from | Common models | Use cases |
|------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Word** | Individual words | Word2Vec, GloVe | Text analysis |
| **Sentence** | Full sentences | Sentence-BERT | Semantic search |
| **Document** | Entire documents | Doc2Vec | Document similarity |
| **Image** | Visual content | CLIP, ResNet | Image search |

## Embeddings in Meilisearch

Meilisearch can generate embeddings automatically using configured embedders:

```json
PATCH /indexes/products/settings
{
  "embedders": {
    "default": {
      "source": "openAi",
      "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
      "documentTemplate": "A product titled '{{doc.name}}' described as: {{doc.description}}"
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can provide pre-computed embeddings in the `_vectors` field when adding documents.

## Document templates

Document templates control which fields Meilisearch uses to generate embeddings. A good template focuses on the most semantically relevant content:

```
A {{doc.category}} product: {{doc.name}}. {{doc.description}}
```

## Embedding dimensions

Different models produce embeddings of different sizes:

| Model | Dimensions |
|-------|------------|
| OpenAI text-embedding-3-small | 1536 |
| OpenAI text-embedding-3-large | 3072 |
| Cohere embed-english-v3.0 | 1024 |

Larger embeddings capture more nuance but require more storage and computation.
