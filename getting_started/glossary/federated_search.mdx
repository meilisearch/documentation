description: Federated search queries multiple indexes simultaneously and returns unified, ranked results from a single request.
---

Federated search allows you to search across multiple indexes with a single query and receive unified, ranked results. Instead of making separate requests to each index, you get one combined result set ordered by relevance.

## Why use federated search

Many applications store different types of content in separate indexes:

- **E-commerce**: Products, categories, brands, articles
- **Documentation**: Guides, API references, tutorials, changelogs
- **Marketplaces**: Listings, sellers, reviews

Without federated search, users would need to search each index separately or you'd need to combine results client-side. Federated search handles this at the engine level.

## How federated search works

1. **Single request**: Send one query targeting multiple indexes
2. **Parallel search**: Meilisearch searches all specified indexes simultaneously
3. **Score normalization**: Results from different indexes are made comparable
4. **Unified ranking**: All results are merged and sorted by relevance
5. **Single response**: One result set with results from all indexes

## Federated search in Meilisearch

Use the [multi-search endpoint](/reference/api/multi-search/overview) with federation enabled:

```json
POST /multi-search
{
  "federation": {},
  "queries": [
    { "indexUid": "products", "q": "wireless headphones" },
    { "indexUid": "brands", "q": "wireless headphones" },
    { "indexUid": "articles", "q": "wireless headphones" }
  ]
}
```

The response contains merged results:

```json
{
  "hits": [
    { "title": "Sony WH-1000XM5", "_federation": { "indexUid": "products" } },
    { "name": "Sony Audio", "_federation": { "indexUid": "brands" } },
    { "title": "Best Wireless Headphones 2024", "_federation": { "indexUid": "articles" } }
  ]
}
```

## Federation options

Control how results are combined:

```json
{
  "federation": {
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0
  },
  "queries": [
    {
      "indexUid": "products",
      "q": "headphones",
      "federationOptions": { "weight": 1.5 }
    },
    {
      "indexUid": "articles",
      "q": "headphones",
      "federationOptions": { "weight": 0.8 }
    }
  ]
}
```

- **weight**: Boost or reduce results from specific indexes
- **limit/offset**: Paginate the unified results

## Federated vs multi-search

| Feature | Multi-search | Federated search |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Queries** | Multiple indexes | Multiple indexes |
| **Response** | Separate results per index | Unified, merged results |
| **Ranking** | Per-index | Global across all indexes |
| **Use case** | Different queries per index | Same query, unified results |
