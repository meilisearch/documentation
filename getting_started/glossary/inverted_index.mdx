---

An **inverted index** is a data structure that maps words (tokens) to the documents containing them. It's the core technology enabling fast full-text search.

## How it works

Instead of scanning every document to find matches, an inverted index flips the relationship:

```
"coffee" → [Doc1, Doc3, Doc5]
"beans"  → [Doc3, Doc4]
"organic" → [Doc1, Doc5]
```

When you search for "coffee beans", the engine:
1. Looks up "coffee" → gets [Doc1, Doc3, Doc5]
2. Looks up "beans" → gets [Doc3, Doc4]
3. Intersects the sets → Doc3 contains both

This is orders of magnitude faster than reading every document.

## What Meilisearch stores

Meilisearch's inverted indexes store more than just document IDs:

| Data | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Document IDs** | Which documents contain the term |
| **Positions** | Where in the document the term appears |
| **Field information** | Which attribute contains the term |

Position data enables phrase searching and proximity ranking. Field information supports attribute-based ranking.

## Multiple indexes

Meilisearch creates nearly 20 inverted indexes per document index to support different features:

- Word-to-document mapping
- Prefix-to-document mapping (for search-as-you-type)
- Filterable attribute indexes
- Sortable attribute indexes

## Building the index

When you add documents, Meilisearch:

1. **Tokenizes** text into individual words
2. **Normalizes** tokens (lowercase, remove accents)
3. **Updates** the inverted index mappings
4. **Stores** position and field metadata

This happens during indexing, not at search time, which is why searches are fast.

## Example

Given these documents:

```json
[
  {"id": 1, "title": "Coffee Brewing Guide"},
  {"id": 2, "title": "Tea Brewing Methods"},
  {"id": 3, "title": "Coffee Bean Selection"}
]
```

The inverted index for `title` would include:

```
"coffee"   → [1, 3]
"brewing"  → [1, 2]
"guide"    → [1]
"tea"      → [2]
"methods"  → [2]
"bean"     → [3]
"selection" → [3]
```
