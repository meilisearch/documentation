Facets are the clickable filter categories you see alongside search results, like "Brand," "Price range," or "Color." They let users narrow down results by selecting attribute values, and show how many results match each option.

## Facets vs filters

In Meilisearch, facets and filters use the same underlying feature:

| Term | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **Filter** | A constraint that narrows search results |
| **Facet** | A filter displayed with counts in the UI |

Any filterable attribute can be used as a facet. The difference is in how you present it to users.

## How facets work

1. **Configure filterable attributes** in index settings
2. **Request facet distribution** in search queries
3. **Display counts** to users (e.g., "Nike (45)")
4. **Apply filters** when users select options

## Example

### 1. Configure filterable attributes

```bash
curl -X PATCH "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/indexes/products/settings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "filterableAttributes": ["brand", "category", "price"]
  }'
```

### 2. Search with facets

```json
POST /indexes/products/search
{
  "q": "running shoes",
  "facets": ["brand", "category"]
}
```

### 3. Response includes facet distribution

```json
{
  "hits": [...],
  "facetDistribution": {
    "brand": {
      "Nike": 45,
      "Adidas": 32,
      "Puma": 18
    },
    "category": {
      "Running": 65,
      "Training": 20,
      "Casual": 10
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Apply a filter

```json
POST /indexes/products/search
{
  "q": "running shoes",
  "filter": "brand = 'Nike'",
  "facets": ["brand", "category"]
}
```

## Filter syntax

Meilisearch supports various filter expressions:

| Expression | Example |
|------------|---------|
| Equality | `brand = 'Nike'` |
| Inequality | `price != 0` |
| Comparison | `price > 50`, `price <= 200` |
| Range | `price 50 TO 200` |
| IN | `brand IN ['Nike', 'Adidas']` |
| AND/OR | `brand = 'Nike' AND price < 100` |
| NOT | `NOT category = 'Sale'` |

## Common use cases

- **E-commerce**: Filter by brand, price, size, color, rating
- **Job boards**: Filter by location, salary, experience level
- **Real estate**: Filter by price, bedrooms, neighborhood
- **Content sites**: Filter by category, date, author
