Tasks are asynchronous operations in Meilisearch. When you add documents, update settings, or perform other resource-intensive operations, Meilisearch creates a task and processes it in the background. This keeps search fast while heavy work happens asynchronously.

## Why tasks exist

Search must be fast. If adding 100,000 documents blocked all searches until complete, users would experience delays. Tasks solve this by:

1. Immediately acknowledging your request
2. Queuing the work for background processing
3. Letting you check progress anytime

## Asynchronous operations

These operations create tasks:

| Operation | Task type |
|-----------|-----------|
| Add/update documents | `documentAdditionOrUpdate` |
| Delete documents | `documentDeletion` |
| Create/update/delete index | `indexCreation`, `indexUpdate`, `indexDeletion` |
| Update settings | `settingsUpdate` |
| Swap indexes | `indexSwap` |
| Create dump | `dumpCreation` |
| Create snapshot | `snapshotCreation` |

## Task lifecycle

```
enqueued → processing → succeeded/failed/canceled
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `enqueued` | Waiting in queue |
| `processing` | Currently running |
| `succeeded` | Completed successfully |
| `failed` | Completed with error |
| `canceled` | Stopped before completion |

## Working with tasks

### Check a task's status

When you create a task, you get a `taskUid`:

```json
{
  "taskUid": 1,
  "indexUid": "movies",
  "status": "enqueued",
  "enqueuedAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Check its progress:

```bash
curl "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/tasks/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}"
```

### List recent tasks

```bash
curl "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/tasks?limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}"
```

### Filter tasks

```bash
# Failed tasks only
curl "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/tasks?statuses=failed"

# Tasks for a specific index
curl "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/tasks?indexUids=movies"

# Specific task types
curl "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/tasks?types=documentAdditionOrUpdate"
```

## Task queue

Tasks are processed **in order** (FIFO). A task won't start until all previous tasks complete. This ensures data consistency but means large tasks can delay subsequent ones.

## Handling failures

Failed tasks include error details:

```json
{
  "uid": 5,
  "status": "failed",
  "error": {
    "message": "Document id `123` not found.",
    "code": "document_not_found",
    "type": "invalid_request",
    "link": "https://docs.meilisearch.com/errors#document_not_found"
  }
}
```

## Webhooks

Configure webhooks to receive notifications when tasks complete:

```json
POST /indexes/movies/settings
{
  "taskWebhook": {
    "url": "https://your-app.com/webhook",
    "events": ["succeeded", "failed"]
  }
}
```
