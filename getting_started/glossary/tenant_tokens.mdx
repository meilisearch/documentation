description: Tenant tokens enable multitenancy by restricting which documents users can access within an index.
---

Tenant tokens are encrypted credentials that restrict which documents a user can search within an index. They enable **multitenancy**—allowing multiple users to share the same index while only seeing their own data.

## Why tenant tokens exist

API keys control access to indexes, but they can't restrict access to specific documents within an index. If your application stores data from multiple users in one index, you need tenant tokens to ensure users only see their own documents.

## How tenant tokens work

```
API Key (index access) + Filter Rules (document access) = Tenant Token
```

A tenant token combines:
1. **An API key** with search permissions
2. **Filter rules** that automatically apply to every search

When a user searches with a tenant token, Meilisearch automatically adds the embedded filters, ensuring they only see permitted documents.

## Example

A SaaS CRM stores contacts from multiple companies in one index. Each document has a `company_id` field:

```json
{ "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "company_id": "acme" }
{ "id": 2, "name": "Bob", "company_id": "globex" }
```

**Create a tenant token for Acme users:**

```javascript
const tenantToken = client.generateTenantToken(
  apiKeyUid,
  {
    "contacts": {
      "filter": "company_id = 'acme'"
    }
  },
  { expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 3600000) }
)
```

When Acme users search, they only see contacts with `company_id = 'acme'`, even without specifying a filter.

## Tenant tokens vs API keys

| Feature | API Keys | Tenant Tokens |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Access level | Entire index | Filtered documents |
| Generated by | Meilisearch | Your application |
| Storage | Stored in Meilisearch | Not stored (stateless) |
| Expiration | Optional | Required (short-lived) |
| Use case | Server-side access | Client-side/user access |

## Token structure

Tenant tokens contain:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `searchRules` | Filters that apply to searches |
| `apiKeyUid` | The parent API key's UID |
| `expiresAt` | When the token becomes invalid |

## Security best practices

- **Short expiration**: Tokens should expire within hours, not days
- **Generate server-side**: Never expose API keys to clients
- **Use HTTPS**: Tokens are bearer credentials
- **Refresh tokens**: Generate new tokens as needed

## Common use cases

- **SaaS applications**: Isolate customer data
- **Marketplaces**: Sellers see only their listings
- **Team workspaces**: Users see only their organization's data
- **Role-based access**: Different views for different user roles
