Vector search is a method for finding information based on meaning rather than exact word matches. It transforms both your data and search queries into numerical representations called [vector embeddings](/getting_started/glossary/vector_embeddings), then finds the closest matches in this mathematical space.

## How vector search works

1. **Indexing**: Documents are converted into vector embeddings using a machine learning model. Each embedding is an array of numbers (typically hundreds or thousands of dimensions) that captures the semantic meaning of the content.

2. **Querying**: When a user searches, their query is converted into a vector using the same model.

3. **Matching**: The system compares the query vector against all document vectors, finding those that are mathematically closest (most similar in meaning).

4. **Ranking**: Results are returned ordered by similarity score.

## Why vector search matters

Traditional keyword search fails when users don't know the exact terms in your data:

| Query | Keyword search | Vector search |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| "world warm" | No results | Climate change, global warming |
| "cheap flights" | Only "cheap flights" | Budget airlines, discount travel |
| "fix slow computer" | Exact matches only | Performance optimization guides |

Vector search understands that "laptop" and "notebook computer" are related concepts, even though they share no words.

## Similarity metrics

Vector search uses mathematical functions to measure how close two vectors are:

- **Cosine similarity**: Measures the angle between vectors. Most common for text.
- **Euclidean distance**: Measures straight-line distance between points.
- **Dot product**: Fast calculation, works well for normalized vectors.

## Vector search in Meilisearch

Meilisearch supports vector search through its [AI-powered search](/products/hybrid_search/getting_started) features. You can:

- Use built-in embedder integrations (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
- Provide your own pre-computed vectors
- Combine vector search with keyword search using [hybrid search](/getting_started/glossary/hybrid_search)

## Example

```json
POST /indexes/movies/search
{
  "vector": [0.123, 0.456, 0.789, ...],
  "hybrid": {
    "semanticRatio": 1.0,
    "embedder": "default"
  }
}
```
