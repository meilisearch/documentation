# Laravel Scout guide

In this guide, you will see how to setup [Laravel Scout](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/scout) to use Meilisearch in your Laravel 10 application.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- PHP
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

You will also need a Laravel application. If you don't have one, you can create a new one by running the following command:

```sh
composer create-project laravel/laravel my-application
```

## Installing Laravel Scout

Laravel comes with out-of-the-box full-text search capabilities via Laravel Scout.

To enable it, navigate to your Laravel application directory and install Scout via the Composer package manager:

```sh
composer require laravel/scout
```

After installing Scout, you need to publish the Scout configuration file. You can do this by running the following `artisan` command:

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Scout\ScoutServiceProvider"
```

This command should create a new configuration file in your application directory: `config/scout.php`.

## Configuring the Laravel Scout driver

Now you need to configure Laravel Scout to use the Meilisearch driver. First, install the dependencies required to use Scout with Meilisearch via Composer:

```sh
composer require meilisearch/meilisearch-php http-interop/http-factory-guzzle
```

Then, update the environment variables in your `.env` file:

```sh
SCOUT_DRIVER=meilisearch
# Use the host below if you're running Meilisearch via Laravel Sail
MEILISEARCH_HOST=http://meilisearch:7700
MEILISEARCH_KEY=masterKey
```

### Local development

Laravelâ€™s official Docker development environment, Laravel Sail, comes with a Meilisearch service out-of-the-box. Please note that when running Meilisearch via Sail, Meilisearchâ€™s host is `http://meilisearch:7700` (instead of say, `http://localhost:7700`).

<Capsule intent="note">
Check out Docker [Bridge network driver](https://docs.docker.com/network/drivers/bridge/#differences-between-user-defined-bridges-and-the-default-bridge) documentation for further detail.

### Running in production

For production use cases, we recommend using a managed Meilisearch via [Meilisearch Cloud](https://www.meilisearch.com/cloud?utm_campaign=laravel&utm_source=docs&utm_medium=laravel-scout-guide). On Meilisearch Cloud, you can find your host URL in your project settings.

<Capsule intent="tip">
Read the [Meilisearch Cloud quick start](/learn/getting_started/cloud_quick_start).
</Capsule>

If you prefer to self-host, read our guide for [running Meilisearch in production](/guides/deployment/running_production).

## Making Eloquent models searchable

With Scout installed and configured, add the `Laravel\Scout\Searchable` trait to your Eloquent models to make them searchable. This trait will use Laravelâ€™s model observers to keep the data in your model in sync with Meilisearch.

Hereâ€™s an example model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Laravel\Scout\Searchable;

class Contact extends Model
{
	use Searchable;
}
```

To configure which fields to store in Meilisearch, use the `toSearchableArray` method. You can use this technique to store a model and its relationshipsâ€™ data in the same document.

The example below shows how to store a model's relationships data in Meilisearch:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use App\Models\Company;
use Laravel\Scout\Searchable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;

class Contact extends Model
{
    use Searchable;

    public function company(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Company::class);
    }

    public function toSearchableArray(): array
    {
	      // All model attributes are made searchable
        $array = $this->toArray();

		    // Then we add some additional fields
        $array['organization_id'] = $this->company->organization->id;
        $array['company_name'] = $this->company->name;
        $array['company_url'] = $this->company->url;

        return $array;
    }
}
```

## Configuring filterable and sortable attributes

Configure which attributes are [filterable](/learn/fine_tuning_results/filtering) and [sortable](/learn/fine_tuning_results/sorting) via your Meilisearch index settings.

In Laravel, you can configure your index settings via the `config/scout.php` file:

```php
<?php

use App\Models\Contact;

return [
	  // Other Scout configuration...

    'meilisearch' => [
        'host' => env('MEILISEARCH_HOST', 'https://edge.meilisearch.com'),
        'key' => env('MEILISEARCH_KEY'),
        'index-settings' => [
            Contact::class => [
                'filterableAttributes' => ['organization_id'],
                'sortableAttributes' => ['name', 'company_name']
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
```

The example above updates Meilisearch index settings for the `Contact` model:

- it makes the `organization_id` field filterable
- it makes the `name` and `company_name` fields sortable

After changing your index settings, you will need to synchronize your Scout index settings.

## Synchronizing your index settings

To synchronize your index settings, run the following command:

```sh
php artisan scout:sync-index-settings
```

## Example usage

You built an example application to demonstrate how to use Meilisearch with Laravel Scout. It showcases an app-wide search in a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application.

[![Laravel Scout example application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/add-laravel-multitenancy-guide/assets/images/demos/saas-demo-screenshot.png)](https://saas.meilisearch.com/?utm_campaign=laravel&utm_source=docs&utm_medium=laravel-scout-guide)

This demo application uses the following features:
- [Multi-search](/reference/api/multi_search) (search across multiple indexes)
- [Multi-tenancy](/learn/security/tenant_tokens)
- [Filtering](/learn/fine_tuning_results/filtering)
- [Sorting](/learn/fine_tuning_results/sorting)

Of course, the code is open-sourced on [Github](https://github.com/meilisearch/saas-demo). ðŸŽ‰
