# Search

Once your documents have been ingested into MeiliSearch, you can search them.

## Sorting documents

> It would not be a search engine if there wasn't a notion of relevancy in the results returned.

When all documents matching the request have been collected, MeiliSearch sorts them using a **[bucket sort](/guides/advanced_guides/bucket_sort.md)** and a list of **built-in [ranking rules](/guides/main_concepts/relevancy.md#ranking-rules)**.

## Search parameters

Searching is highly customizable. You can **configure the search parameters** to refine your search even further.

[Learn more about the search parameters](/guides/advanced_guides/search_parameters.md)

## Give it a try!

We also deliver an **out-of-the-box web interface** in which you can test MeiliSearch interactively.

Follow [this guide](/guides/advanced_guides/web_interface.md) to give the search engine a try!
