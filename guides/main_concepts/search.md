# Search

MeiliSearch has been designed to improve your search experience.

## Simple and Intuitive

For developers, it requires very little configuration to be up and running.

For users, the search experience aims to feel simple and intuitive so they can focus on the results. MeiliSearch delivers an intuitive search-as-you-type experience that can answer under 50 milliseconds.

## Highly Customizable

MeiliSearch works out-of-the-box with default settings that meet the needs of most projects.

However, searching is highly customizable.

> It would not be a search engine if there wasn't a notion of relevancy in the results returned.

The returned results are **sorted according to a set of consecutive rules called [ranking rules](/guides/main_concepts/relevancy.md#ranking-rules)**. You can delete existing rules, add new ones, or even change the order in which they are executed.

You can also **configure the [search parameters](/guides/advanced_guides/search_parameters.md)** to refine your search even further.

### Give it a try!

We also deliver an **out-of-the-box web interface** in which you can test MeiliSearch interactively.

Follow [this guide](/guides/advanced_guides/web_interface.md) to give the search engine a try!
