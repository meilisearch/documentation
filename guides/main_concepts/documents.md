# Documents

**Documents** are objects composed of fields containing any type of data.</br>
A **field** is composed of an **attribute** and its associated data.

```json
{
  "id": 3205,
  "title": "Interstellar",
  "description": "This is a great movie.",
  "type": ["sci fi", "space"]
}
```

#### Wording

- **Attribute**: `"id"`, `"title"`, `"description"` and `"type"`.
- **Field**: the combination of attributes and data (i.e, `"title": "Interstellar"`)
- **Document**: The combination of all the fields between brackets.

## Structure

A document is added to MeiliSearch in `JSON format`.<br/>
When using the [route to add new documents](/references/documents.md#add-or-update-documents), all documents should be sent in an array. And this, even if there is only one document.

```bash
curl -X POST `http://localhost:7700/indexes/movie/documents` \
--data '[
  {
    "movie_id": "123sq178",
    "title": "Amelie Poulain"
  }
]'
```

A **document must contain** [one identifier field](/guides/main_concepts/documents.md#identifier) to be indexed in MeiliSearch.

## Fields

All fields present in a document are automatically <glossary word="searchable" /> and <glossary word="displayed" />.
The way MeiliSearch handles a field is customizable in the settings <Badge text="soon" type="warn"/>. You can make a field only searchable, or only displayed, or none, in this case, MeiliSearch will completely ignore the field when it is sent on document addition.

You can also add <glossary word="ranking rules" /> on a field, to, for example, add a rule that makes recent movies more relevant than older ones.

## Identifier

An identifier is an <glossary word="attribute" /> with a unique value found in each document of a given index. It is used to store the document in the index.

Each index recognizes **only one** identifier attribute. Once the [identifier is set on the index](/guides/main_concepts/documents.md#setting-the-identifier), it **cannot be changed**.

**Example:**

In an index called `movie` there are 200k `documents`. Each of these 200k documents has an identifier called `movie_id` whose value is unique.

```json
[
  {
    "movie_id" : "1564saqw12ss",
    "title" : "Kung fu Panda"
  },
  {
    "movie_id" : "15k1j2kkw223s",
    "title" : "Batman"
  }
]
```

If the identifier is not found in a document, it will not be added.

### Setting the identifier

MeiliSearch has several ways of knowing which field is the `identifier`.

- MeiliSearch [automatically infers the identifier](/guides/main_concepts/documents.md#meilisearch-infers-your-identifier) based on your first document.
- You set it [on index creation](/references/indexes.md#create-an-index)
- You set it [on document addition](/references/documents.md#add-or-replace-documents)

#### MeiliSearch infers your identifier

If no identifier has been given through the index creation or through document additions, MeiliSearch will search for the identifier field in the first document sent.

MeiliSearch will search for an attribute that contains the string `id` in any way case-insensitively. (i.e, `uid`, `MovieId`, `ID`, `123id123`).
If none has been found, no documents will be added.

#### Missing identifier error

❗️ If you get the `missing identifier` error, it means MeiliSearch could not recognize your identifier. This means your identifier does not answer the formatting explained above. To solve this error, you could send the [identifier's name as a query parameter](/references/documents.md#add-or-replace-documents) or [update your index to add the identifier's name](/references/indexes.md#create-an-index) as explained in: [setting the identifier](/guides/main_concepts/documents.md#identifier).

### Identifier value format

The identifier **value** may contain only `A-Z a-z 0-0` and `-_` characters.

#### Examples

Good:
```
"id": "_Aabc012_"
```
Bad:
```
"id": "@BI+* ^5h2%"
```


The document addition request in MeiliSearch is [atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)). Thus, if you add 200 documents in one go and if one of the documents has a badly formatted identifier, an error will occur, and none of the documents will be added.
