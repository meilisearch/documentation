Chat workspaces are at the heart of Meilisearch's conversational search feature. This guide explains what they are, how they work, and best practices for using them.

## What are chat workspaces?

Chat workspaces are isolated configurations that define how your conversational search behaves. Think of them as different "personalities" or "assistants" that can answer questions about your data in specific ways.

### Key characteristics

- **Automatically created**: No need to explicitly create workspaces â€“ they're created when you configure them
- **Isolated configurations**: Each workspace has its own LLM settings and prompts
- **Stateless**: No conversation history is stored between requests
- **Multi-tenant ready**: Perfect for SaaS applications with different customers

## Creating your first workspace

The beauty of workspaces is their simplicity. Just configure one and it exists:

```bash
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/chats/my-first-assistant/settings' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer MASTER_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "source": "openAi",
    "apiKey": "sk-...",
    "prompts": {
      "system": "You are a friendly assistant who loves to help!"
    }
  }'
```

That's it! The workspace `my-first-assistant` now exists and is ready to use.

## Workspace isolation and privacy

Each workspace is completely isolated:

- **Configuration isolation**: Settings don't affect other workspaces
- **No shared context**: Conversations in one workspace don't affect others
- **No data storage**: Meilisearch doesn't store any conversation data

This means:

- Complete privacy for your users
- No cross-contamination between different use cases
- Full compliance with data protection regulations

## Best practices

### 1. Use descriptive workspace names

```bash
# Good examples:
/chats/customer-support/settings
/chats/product-recommendations/settings
/chats/technical-docs/settings

# Less clear:
/chats/ws1/settings
/chats/test/settings
```

### 2. Optimize prompts for each use case

```json
{
  "prompts": {
    "system": "You are a helpful customer support agent. Be empathetic, professional, and always try to solve the customer's problem based on our documentation."
  }
}
```

### 3. Configure relevant indexes

Use the [conversation settings](/reference/api/settings#conversation) to optimize how each index presents data:

```json
{
  "description": "Product catalog with electronics and accessories",
  "documentTemplate": "Product: {{doc.name}} - {{doc.description}} (Price: ${{doc.price}})",
  "searchParameters": {
    "limit": 5,
    "sort": ["popularity:desc"]
  }
}
```

## Common use cases

### Multi-tenant SaaS

Create workspaces per customer:

```
/chats/customer-123/settings
/chats/customer-456/settings
```

### Multiple departments

Different assistants for different teams:

```
/chats/sales-team/settings
/chats/support-team/settings
/chats/engineering-docs/settings
```

### A/B testing

Test different prompts or models:

```
/chats/assistant-v1/settings
/chats/assistant-v2-friendly/settings
```
