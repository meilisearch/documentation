# Comparison to alternatives

## About MeiliSearch

MeiliSearch has been designed to be a ready-to-go open source solution and deliver an intuitive and instantaneous search experience. As the amount of information available on the websites increases as time goes by, it is essential to provide users with the most relevant results. Since many closed source search engines and open source alternatives can be used, determining which one to install is critical and may not seem easy at first.  
The present article covers a comparison of alternatives to MeiliSearch, i.e. available search technologies to be considered when willing to implement a search bar.  


## A Quick Look at the Search Engine Landscape

### Open Source

#### Lucene

Apache Lucene is a free and open source search library, built in Java, used for the full text indexing and search of documents. This project was first created in 1999 by Doug Cutting who had previously written search engines at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and Apple. Since Lucene has been developed to build web search applications such as Google, you’ll see that DuckDuckGo still uses it for some specific searches.  

Lucene has since been divided into several projects:  
— Lucene itself, the full-text search library  
— Solr, an enterprise search server with a powerful REST API  
— Nutch, an extensible and scalable web crawler relying on Apache Hadoop  

Nowadays, since Lucene is a widely used tool, it is considered as the reference search library and many open source or closed source search engines are based on it.
