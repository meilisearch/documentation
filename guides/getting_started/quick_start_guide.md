# Quick Start Guide

This quick tour will help you get started with MeiliSearch in only a few steps.

## Download and launch

First of all, you must have access to a running instance of MeiliSearch.

There are [several download possibilities](/guides/advanced_guides/installation.md#download-and-launch).

:::: tabs
::: tab cURL
Download the **latest stable release** of MeiliSearch with **curl**.

Launch MeiliSearch to start the server.
```bash
$ curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh
$ ./meilisearch
Server is listening on: http://127.0.0.1:7700
```
:::

::: tab Brew
Download the **latest stable release** of MeiliSearch with **Homebrew**.

Launch MeiliSearch to start the server.
```bash
$ brew update && brew install meilisearch
$ meilisearch
Server is listening on: http://127.0.0.1:7700
```
:::

::: tab Docker
Using **Docker** you can choose to run [any available tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/getmeili/meilisearch/tags).

This command starts the **latest stable release** of MeiliSearch.
```bash
$ docker run -it --rm -p 7700:7700 -v $(pwd)/data.ms:/data.ms getmeili/meilisearch
Server is listening on: http://0.0.0.0:7700
```

::: warning
Docker is not persistent. You should share a volume to make your container filesystem persistent. MeiliSearch write its data at `/data.ms`
:::

::: tab APT

Download the **latest stable release** of MeiliSearch with **APT**.

Launch MeiliSearch to start the server.
```bash
$ echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/meilisearch/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fury.list
$ apt update && apt install meilisearch-http
$ meilisearch
Server is listening on: http://127.0.0.1:7700
```
:::

::: tab Heroku

You can deploy the latest stable build of MeiliSearch straight on Heroku.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch">
    <img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy">
  </a>
</p>

The deploy can take up to 20 minutes because it will compile the whole project from the GitHub repository.

::: warning
The [Heroku filesystem is ephemeral](https://help.heroku.com/K1PPS2WM/why-are-my-file-uploads-missing-deleted), which means you may lose your data on any restart of the Heroku instance. **The Heroku deploy is okay for testing purposes, but it won't work for production.**
:::

::: tab Source

MeiliSearch is made in `Rust`. Therefore the Rust toolchain must [be installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to compile the project.

If you have the Rust toolchain already installed, you need to clone the repository and go to the cloned directory.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch
$ cd MeiliSearch
```

Inside the folder, compile MeiliSearch.

```bash
# Production version
$ cargo build --release

# Debug version
$ cargo build
```

Compiling in release mode takes more time than in debug mode but the binary process time will be significantly faster. You **must** run a release binary when using MeiliSearch in production.

You can find the compiled binary in `target/debug` or `target/release`.

```bash
# Excuting the server binary
$ ./target/release/meilisearch
```

[Environment variables and flags](/guides/advanced_guides/installation.md#environment-variables-and-flags) can be set before and on launch. With them, you can among other things add the **master key** or set the **port**.

### Communicate with MeiliSearch

Now that our meilisearch server is up and running, we will be able to communicate with it.

This is done through a [RESTFul API](/references/README.md) or one of our [SDKs](/resources/sdks.md).

## Create your Index

In MeiliSearch, the information is subdivided into indexes. Each [index](/guides/main_concepts/indexes.md) contains a data structure and the associated documents.
The indexes can be imagined as SQL tables. But you won't need to define the table because MeiliSearch is <glossary word="schemaless"/>.
In order to be able to store our documents in an index, we have to create one first.

:::: tabs

::: tab cURL

[API references](/references/indexes.md)
```bash
$ curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes' \
  --data '{
  "uid" : "movies"
}'
```
:::

::: tab JS

```js
meili.createIndex({
    uid: "movies"
})
```
:::

::: tab Ruby

```ruby
client.create_index(uid: 'movies')
```
:::

::: tab PHP

```php
$client->createIndex('movies');
```
:::

::: tab Python

```python
client.create_index(uid="movies")
```
:::
::::


## Add Documents

Once the index has been created, it needs to be filled with [documents](/guides/main_concepts/documents.md). It is these documents that will be used and returned when searches are done on MeiliSearch.

Documents are sent to MeiliSearch in JSON format.

To be processed by MeiliSearch, all documents need one common <glossary word="field" /> which will serve as [identifier](/guides/main_concepts/documents.md#identifier) for the document. The value in this field must be **unique**.

There are [several ways to let MeiliSearch know what your document identifier](/guides/main_concepts/documents.md#identifier) is, the easiest way is to have an <glossary word="attribute" /> that contains the string `id` case-insensitively.


Let's use an example [movies.json dataset](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/blob/master/datasets/movies/movies.json) to showcase how to add documents.


:::: tabs

::: tab Curl

[API references](/references/documents.md)
```bash
$ curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/documents' \
  --data @movies.json
```
:::

::: tab JS

```js
const movies = require('./movies.json')
meili
    .Index("movies")
    .addDocuments(movies)
```
:::

::: tab Ruby

```ruby
index.add_documents(movies)
```
:::

::: tab PHP

```php
$index->addOrReplaceDocuments($movies);
```
:::

::: tab Python

```python
index = self.client.get_index(uid="movies")
json_file = open('movies.json')
data = json.load(json_file)
response = index.add_documents(data)
```
:::
::::

### Checking updates

In MeiliSearch, most actions are asynchronous. This lets you stack actions. They will be executed in the order in which they were made.

You can [track the state of each action](/guides/advanced_guides/asynchronous_updates.md).


## Searches

Now that our documents have been added to MeiliSearch we are be able to [search](/guides/main_concepts/search.md) in it.

MeiliSearch [offers many parameters](/guides/advanced_guides/search_parameters.md) that you can play with to refine your search or change the format of the returned documents. However, by default the search is already relevant.

The search engine is now aware of our documents and can serve those via our HTTP server.

```bash
$ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/indexes/12345678/search?q=botman'
```

:::: tabs

::: tab Curl

[API references](/references/search.md)
```bash
$ curl \
  -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/indexes/12345678/search?q=botman'
```
:::

::: tab JS

```js
meili
  .Index('movies')
  .search({
    q: 'batman',
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response)
  })
```
:::

::: tab Ruby

```ruby
index.search('botman')
```
:::

::: tab PHP

```php
$index->search('botman');
```
:::

::: tab Python

```python
index.search({
  'q': 'How to Train Your Dragon'
})
```
:::
::::

MeiliSearch **response** :
