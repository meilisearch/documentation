# What's next?

MeiliSearch was built on a few core concepts. If you haven't already done so, we invite you to explore the following pages that will give you an essential insight into our search engine:

- [Indexes](/guides/main_concepts/indexes.md)
- [Documents](/guides/main_concepts/documents.md)
- [Search](/guides/main_concepts/search.md)
- [Relevancy](/guides/main_concepts/relevancy.md)

You can find the API references here:

- [API References](/references/README.md)

And additional resources here:

- [SDKs](/resources/sdks.md)
- [FAQ](/faq/)
- [Postman collection](/resources/postman_collection.md): it can be tedious to re-write every route when wanting to try out an API. Try out MeiliSearch with our collection in Postman

Tutorials and Cookbooks are currently being prepared. They will be available soon.
