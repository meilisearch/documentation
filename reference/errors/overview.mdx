## Errors

All detailed task responses contain an [`error`](/reference/api/tasks#error) field. When a task fails, it is always accompanied by a JSON-formatted error response. Meilisearch errors can be of one of the following types:

| Type                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`invalid_request`** | This is due to an error in the user input. It is accompanied by the HTTP code `4xx`                                                                                                             |
| **`internal`**        | This is due to machine or configuration constraints. It is accompanied by the HTTP code `5xx`                                                                                                   |
| **`auth`**            | This type of error is related to authentication and authorization. It is accompanied by the HTTP code `4xx`                                                                                     |
| **`system`**          | This indicates your system has reached or exceeded its limit for disk size, index size, open files, or the database doesn't have read or write access. It is accompanied by the HTTP code `5xx` |
