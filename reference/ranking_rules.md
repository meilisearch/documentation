# Ranking rules

_Child route of the [settings route](/reference/settings.md)._

Ranking rules are built-in rules that allow you to **customize the relevancy of your search results**. They are stored in an array and applied in order of appearance.

Ranking rules can also be updated directly through the [global settings route](/reference/settings.md#update-settings) along with the other settings.

To learn more about ranking rules, refer to our [dedicated guide](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy.md).

::: warning
Updating the settings means overwriting the default settings of Meilisearch. You can reset to default values using the `DELETE` routes.
