Compact an index to reclaim disk space. This operation removes deleted documents from the index storage.

<Note>
This is useful after deleting a large number of documents, as deletions don't immediately free disk space.
</Note>

<Warning>
Compacting an index is a resource-intensive operation. Run it during low-traffic periods.
