The `/compact` route allows you to reclaim disk space by removing deleted documents from the index storage.

<Note>
When you delete documents, Meilisearch marks them as deleted but doesn't immediately free the disk space. Compacting removes this unused space.
</Note>

<Warning>
Compacting is a resource-intensive operation. Run it during low-traffic periods.
</Warning>

## When to compact

- After deleting a large number of documents
- When disk usage is higher than expected
- As part of regular maintenance
