description: The /tasks route allows you to manage and monitor Meilisearch's asynchronous operations.
---

The `/tasks` route gives information about the progress of [asynchronous operations](/products/platform/asynchronous_operations).

<Note>
Meilisearch is an asynchronous API. Most write operations (adding documents, updating settings) return a task that you can monitor to track progress.
