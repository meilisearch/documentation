## Parameters

Parameters are options you can pass to an API endpoint to modify its response. There are three main types of parameters in Meilisearch's API: request body parameters, path parameters, and query parameters.

### Request body parameters

These parameters are mandatory parts of POST, PUT, and PATCH requests. They accept a wide variety of values and data types depending on the resource you're modifying. You must add these parameters to your request's data payload.

### Path parameters

These are parameters you pass to the API in the endpoint's path. They are used to identify a resource uniquely. You can have multiple path parameters, for example, `/indexes/{index_uid}/documents/{document_id}`.

If an endpoint does not take any path parameters, this section is not present in that endpoint's documentation.

### Query parameters

These optional parameters are a sequence of key-value pairs and appear after the question mark (`?`) in the endpoint. You can list multiple query parameters by separating them with an ampersand (`&`). The order of query parameters does not matter. They are mostly used with GET endpoints.

If an endpoint does not take any query parameters, this section is not present in that endpoint's documentation.

## Request body

The request body is data sent to the API. It is used with PUT, POST, and PATCH methods to create or update a resource. You must provide request bodies in JSON.

## Response body

Meilisearch is an **asynchronous API**. This means that in response to most write requests, you will receive a summarized version of the `task` object:

```json
{
    "taskUid": 1,
    "indexUid": "movies",
    "status": "enqueued",
    "type": "indexUpdate",
    "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-11T09:25:53.000000Z"
}
```

You can use this `taskUid` to get more details on [the status of the task](/reference/api/tasks#get-one-task).

See more information about [asynchronous operations](/learn/async/asynchronous_operations).

## Data types

The Meilisearch API supports [JSON data types](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_datatypes.asp).
