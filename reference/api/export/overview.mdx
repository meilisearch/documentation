---

The `/export` route allows you to export documents from one or more indexes. The export is streamed as NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON).

<Note>
Use exports for backing up documents or migrating data between Meilisearch instances.
</Note>

## NDJSON format

Each line contains a single document:

```json
{"id": 1, "title": "Alien", "year": 1979}
{"id": 2, "title": "Aliens", "year": 1986}
{"id": 3, "title": "Alien 3", "year": 1992}
```

## Use cases

- **Backup**: Export documents for safekeeping
- **Migration**: Move data between instances
- **Analysis**: Export for processing in other tools

## Endpoints
