# Snapshots

The `/snapshot` route allows the creation of database snapshots. Snapshots are `.snapshot` files that can be used to make quick backups of Meilisearch data.

[Learn more about snapshots](/learn/advanced/snapshots).

## Create a snapshot

<RouteHighlighter method="POST" route="/snapshots"/>

Triggers a snapshot creation task. Once the process is complete, a snapshot is created in the [snapshot directory](/learn/configuration/instance_options#snapshot-destination). If the snapshot directory does not exist yet, it will be created.

Snapshot tasks take priority over all other tasks in the queue. This means that a newly created snapshot task will be processed as soon as the current task is finished.
