# Ranking rules

_Child route of the [settings route](/reference/api/settings.md)._

Ranking rules are built-in rules that **ensure relevancy in search results**. Ranking rules are applied in a default order which can be changed in the settings. You can add or remove rules and change their order of importance.

Ranking rules can also be updated directly through the [global settings route](/reference/api/settings.md#update-settings) along with the other settings.

[Learn more about ranking rules and their relevancy](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy.md).

::: note
Updating the settings means overwriting the default settings of MeiliSearch. You can reset to default values using the `DELETE` routes.
