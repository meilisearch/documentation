Index fragmentation occurs naturally as you use Meilisearch and can lead to decreased performance over time. `/compact` reorganizes the database and prunes unused space, which may lead to improved indexing and search speeds.

<Tip>
To obtain a rough estimate of your index's fragmentation, query the `/stats` route and compute the ratio between `databaseSize` and `usedDatabaseSize`. If the ratio is >= X.Y, compacting your indexes may improve performance.

## Compact database

<RouteHighlighter method="POST" path="/indexes/{index_uid}/compact" />

Compact the specified index.
