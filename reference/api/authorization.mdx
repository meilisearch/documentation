<Tip>
If you are new to Meilisearch, check out the [getting started guide](/learn/self_hosted/getting_started_with_self_hosted_meilisearch).
</Tip>

By [providing Meilisearch with a master key at launch](/learn/security/basic_security), you protect your instance from unauthorized requests. The provided master key must be at least 16 bytes. From then on, you must include the `Authorization` header along with a valid API key to access protected routes (all routes except [`/health`](/reference/api/health)).

<CodeSamplesAuthorizationHeader1 />

The [`/keys`](/reference/api/keys) route can only be accessed using the master key. For security reasons, we recommend using regular API keys for all other routes.

<Tip>
v0.24 and below use the `X-MEILI-API-KEY: apiKey` authorization header:
