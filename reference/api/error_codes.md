## Error list

### `index_creation_failed`

An error occurred while trying to create an index, check out our guide on [index creation](/learn/core_concepts/indexes.md).

### `index_already_exists`

An index with this UID already exists, check out our guide on [index creation](/learn/core_concepts/indexes.md).

### `index_not_found`

An index with this UID was not found, check out our guide on [index creation](/learn/core_concepts/indexes.md).

### `invalid_index_uid`

### `index_not_accessible`

### `invalid_state`

The database is in an invalid state. Deleting the database and re-indexing should solve the problem.

### `primary_key_inference_failed`

The first provided document contains no fields with the substring `id`. [Manually designate the primary key](/learn/core_concepts/documents.md#setting-the-primary-key) or add `id` to one of your fields so it can be used as the primary key during inference. We recommend manually setting the primary key.

### `document_fields_limit_reached`

A document exceeds the maximum limit of 65,535 fields.

### `missing_document_id`

A document does not contain any value for the required primary key, and is thus invalid. Check documents in the current addition for the invalid ones.

### `invalid_document_id`

### `invalid_filter`

The filter provided with the search is invalid. This may be due to syntax errors in the `filter` parameter, using reserved fields as filter expressions, or neglecting to add the filtering attributes to `filterableAttributes`. For troubleshooting, check our [guide on filtering](/learn/advanced/filtering_and_faceted_search.md).

### `invalid_sort`

The sort value is invalid. This may be due to syntax errors in the `sort` parameter, using reserved fields as sort expressions, or neglecting to add the sorting attributes to `sortableAttributes`. For troubleshooting, check our [guide on sorting](/learn/advanced/sorting.md).
