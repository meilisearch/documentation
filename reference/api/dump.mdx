# Dumps

The `/dumps` route allows the creation of database dumps. Dumps are `.dump` files that can be used to restore Meilisearch data or migrate between different versions.

## Create a dump

<RouteHighlighter method="POST" route="/dumps"/>

Triggers a dump creation task. Once the process is complete, a dump is created in the [dump directory](/learn/self_hosted/configure_meilisearch_at_launch#dump-directory). If the dump directory does not exist yet, it will be created.

Dump tasks take priority over all other tasks in the queue. This means that a newly created dump task will be processed as soon as the current task is finished.
