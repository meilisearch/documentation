Swap the documents, settings, and task history of two or more indexes. You can only swap indexes in pairs. Swapping indexes is an atomic operation: either all indexes are swapped or none are.

<Tip>
Index swapping is useful for zero-downtime deployments when updating large indexes. Create a new index, populate it, then swap it with the production index.
