openapi: post /indexes/{indexUid}/search
---

This is the preferred endpoint to perform search when an API key is required, as it allows for [preflight requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request) to be cached. Caching preflight requests **considerably improves search speed**.

<Note>
By default, this endpoint returns a maximum of 1000 results. If you want to scrape your database, use the [get documents endpoint](/reference/api/documents/overview#get-documents-with-post) instead.
