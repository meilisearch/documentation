# Experimental

The `/experimental-features` route allows you to activate or deactivate some of Meilisearch's [experimental features](/learn/resources/experimental_features_overview).

This route is **synchronous**. This means that no task object will be returned, and any activated or deactivated features will be made available or unavailable immediately.

<Capsule intent="danger">
The experimental API route is not compatible with all experimental features. Consult the [experimental feature overview](/learn/resources/experimental_features_overview) for a compatibility list.

## Experimental features object

```json
{
  "metrics": false,
  "logsRoute": true,
  "vectorStore": false,
}
```

| Name                      | Type    | Description                                                               |
| :------------------------ | :------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **`metrics`**             | Boolean | `true` if feature is active, `false` otherwise |
| **`scoreDetails`**        | Boolean | `true` if feature is active, `false` otherwise |
| **`logsRoute`**           | Boolean | `true` if feature is active, `false` otherwise |
| **`vectorStore`**         | Boolean | `true` if feature is active, `false` otherwise |

## Get all experimental features

<RouteHighlighter method="GET" route="/experimental-features"/>

Get a list of all experimental features that can be activated via the `/experimental-features` route and whether or not they are currently activated.

### Example

<CodeSamples id="get_experimental_features_1" />

#### Response: `200 Ok`

```json
{
  "metrics": false,
  "logsRoute": true,
  "vectorSearch": false,
}
```

## Configure experimental features

<RouteHighlighter method="PATCH" route="/experimental-features"/>

Activate or deactivate experimental features.

<CodeSamples id="update_experimental_features_1" />

Setting a field to `null` leaves its value unchanged.

#### Body

```
{<featureName>: <Boolean>}
```

#### Response: `200 Ok`

```json
{
  "metrics": false,
  "logsRoute": true,
  "vectorSearch": false,
}
```
