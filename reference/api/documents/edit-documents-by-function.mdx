Edit documents with a user-defined function. This endpoint allows you to transform document fields programmatically.

<Note>
This is an experimental feature. You must enable it using the experimental features endpoint before use.
</Note>

The function is a [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/) script that receives each document and can modify it in place.
