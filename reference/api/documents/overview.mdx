## Document object

A document is a JSON object composed of fields. Each field contains an attribute and its associated value.

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Alien",
  "overview": "In space, no one can hear you scream.",
  "genres": ["Science Fiction", "Horror"],
  "release_date": "1979-05-25"
}
```

<Note>
Documents are the basic building blocks of a Meilisearch database. To search through them, you must first add them to an index.
</Note>

## Primary key

Every document must have a unique identifier called a primary key. If you don't specify one, Meilisearch will try to infer it from your documents.
