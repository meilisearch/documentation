The `/multi-search` route allows you to perform multiple search queries in a single HTTP request, improving efficiency.

<Tip>
Multi-search is ideal for autocomplete interfaces, dashboards, or any scenario where you need results from multiple queries or indexes simultaneously.
</Tip>

## Use cases

- **Autocomplete**: Search products, categories, and brands in one request
- **Dashboards**: Populate multiple widgets with a single API call
- **Universal Search**: Search across multiple indexes simultaneously
- **Sharding**: Distribute searches across sharded indexes

## Multi-search vs Federated search

| Feature | Multi-search | Federated search |
|:--------|:-------------|:-----------------|
| Results | Separate per query | Merged into one list |
| Ranking | Per query | Cross-query with weights |
| Use case | Multiple widgets | Unified search results |

## Example request

```json
{
  "queries": [
    { "indexUid": "movies", "q": "avengers" },
    { "indexUid": "actors", "q": "avengers" }
  ]
}
```

## Endpoints

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Perform multi-search" href="/reference/api_v2/multi-search/perform-a-multi-search">
    Execute multiple search queries
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
