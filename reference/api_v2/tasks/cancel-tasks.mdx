openapi: post /tasks/cancel
---

Cancel any number of enqueued or processing tasks based on their uid, status, type, indexUid, or the date at which they were enqueued, started, or finished.

<Warning>
Task cancellation is an atomic operation: either all tasks matching the filter are canceled, or none are. If any of the tasks are already `processing`, `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`, an error will be returned.
</Warning>
