# Sorting

Though MeiliSearch focuses on ordering results by their relevancy, you can set different sorting rules with the `sort` search parameter. For instance, when searching for products in a webshop, a user might be interested in seeing cheaper items before anything else.

## Configuring sort

[intro text briefly describing the full process]

#### Example

[one example putting everything together]

### Adding attributes to `sortableAttributes`

[Describe `sortableAttributes`, explain how to add attributes to it]

#### Example

[new code sample]

#### Order of `sortableAttributes` attributes

[perhaps not a subsection: the internal order of sortableAttributes matters]

##### Example

[no code sample, only arrays and responses]

#### Relevant search vs exhaustive search

[Explain the difference between putting the sort ranking rule at the top and at the bottom of the ranking rules]

##### Example

[new code sample]

## Sorting results

[describe using `sort` search parameter]

[asc vs desc]

[accepts strings and numbers]

#### Example

[at least two new code samples]

### Custom ranking rules

[Describe interaction with custom ranking rules, mention that `sort` can do anything that custom ranking rules does, but much of the behaviour can be defined at search time]
