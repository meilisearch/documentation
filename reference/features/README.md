# Feature References

Want to know something about MeiliSearch? Chances are high that it's written down here.

This section is where we document all of MeiliSearch's user-facing features and tools. The two exceptions are [API routes](/reference/api) and [MeiliSearch engine internals](/reference/under_the_hood): these each have their own section.
