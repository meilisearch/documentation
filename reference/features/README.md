# Feature references

This section is where we document all of Meilisearch's user-facing features and tools. This does not include [API routes](/reference/api) or [details of the Meilisearch engine](/learn/advanced); these each have their own section.

Understanding our reference documentation is easier with background knowledge of Meilisearch's [core concepts](/learn/core_concepts). If you're a **new user**, you might prefer to start with an [explanation of Meilisearch's features](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/features.md) or our [quick start guide](/learn/getting_started/quick_start.md).
