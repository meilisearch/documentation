# Feature References

Want to know something about MeiliSearch? Chances are high that it's written down here.

This section is where we document all of MeiliSearch's user-facing features and tools. This does not include [API routes](/reference/api) or [details of the MeiliSearch engine](/reference/under_the_hood); these each have their own section.

Understanding our reference documentation is easier with background knowledge of MeiliSearch's [core concepts](/learn/core_concepts). If you're a **new user**, you might prefer to start with an [explanation of MeiliSearch's features](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/features.md) or our [quick start guide](/learn/getting_started/quick_start.md).
