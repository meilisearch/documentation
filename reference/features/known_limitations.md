# Known limitations

Currently, MeiliSearch has a number of known limitations. Some of these limitations are the result of intentional design trade-offs, while others can be attributed to [LMDB](/reference/under_the_hood/storage.md), the key-value store that MeiliSearch uses [under the hood](/reference/under_the_hood).

## Design limitations

### Number of query words

**Limitation:** The maximum number of terms taken into account for each [search query](/reference/features/search_parameters.md#query-q) is 10. **If a search query includes more than 10 words, all words after the 10th will be ignored.**

**Explanation:** Queries with many search terms can lead to long response times. This goes against our goal of providing a [fast search-as-you-type experience](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/philosophy.md#front-facing-search).

### Database size

**Limitation:** The default maximum database size is __100GiB__. This size can be modified using the options `--max-index-size` & `--max-udb-size` as described in the [configuration reference](/reference/features/configuration.md#max-index-size).

**Explanation:** MeiliSearch uses two databases: one for storage and one for updates. On launch, LMDB needs to know the maximum size that it will need to reserve on disk for both of them.

### Maximum words per attribute

**Limitation:** MeiliSearch can index a maximum of __1000 words per attribute__. If an attribute contains more than 1000 words, only the first 1000 words will be indexed and the rest will be silently ignored.

**Explanation:** This limit is enforced for relevancy reasons. The more words there are in a given attribute, the less relevant the search queries will be.

### Maximum number of documents in an index

**Limitation:** An index can contain no more than 4,294,967,296 documents.

**Explanation:** This is the largest possible value for a 32-bit unsigned integer. Since  MeiliSearch's engine uses unsigned integers to identify documents internally, this is the maximum number of documents that can be stored in an index.

### Length of individual `filterableAttributes` values

**Limitation:** Individual `filterableAttributes` values are limited to 500 bytes.

**Explanation:** MeiliSearch stores `filterableAttributes` values as keys in LMDB, a datatype whose size is limited to approximately 500 bytes. Note that this only applies to individual valuesâ€”for example, a `genres` attribute can contain any number of values such as `horror`, `comedy`, or `cyberpunk` as long as each one of them is smaller than 500 bytes.

## Other limitations

### Payload size

**Limitation:** The default limit for the payload size is __~100MB__.

**Explanation:** MeiliSearch memory consumption can be an issue in some systems and keeping payload sizes relatively small ensures an optimal experience for most users. [This limit can be modified](/reference/features/configuration.md#payload-limit-size) if you want to take full advantage of particularly powerful hardware.
