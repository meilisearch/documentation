# Search parameters

Search parameters allow you greater control over the results returned by a MeiliSearch query.

::: warning
If [using the `GET` route to perform a search](/reference/api/search.md#search-in-an-index-with-get-route), all parameters must be **URL-encoded**.

This is not necessary when using the `POST` route or one of our [SDKs](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/sdks.md).

## Query (q)

**Parameter**: `q`
**Expected value**: any string
**Default value**: `null`

Sets the search terms.

::: warning
MeiliSearch only considers the first ten words of any given search query. This is necessary in order to deliver a [fast search-as-you-type experience](/reference/features/known_limitations.md#number-of-query-words).

Additionally, keep in mind queries go through a normalization process that strips accents and diacritics, as well as making all terms lowercase.
:::

### Placeholder search

When `q` isn't specified, MeiliSearch performs a **placeholder search**. A placeholder search returns all searchable documents in an index, modified by any search parameters used and sorted by that index's [custom ranking rules](/reference/features/settings#custom-ranking-rule).

If the index has no custom ranking rules, the results are returned in the order of their internal database position.

::: tip
Placeholder search is particularly useful for setting up a [faceted search UI](/reference/features/faceted_search).
:::

### Example

You can search for films mentioning `shifu` by setting the `q` parameter:

<CodeSamples id="search_parameter_guide_query_1" />

This will give you a list of documents that contain your query terms in at least one attribute.

```json
{
  "hits": [
    {
      "id":"50393",
      "title":"Kung Fu Panda Holiday",
      "poster":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/rV77WxY35LuYLOuQvBeD1nyWMuI.jpg",
      "overview":"The Winter Feast is Po's favorite holiday. Every year he and his father hang decorations, cook together, and serve noodle soup to the villagers.",
      "release_date":1290729600,
      "genres":["Animation","Family","TV Movie"]
    },
  ],
  "query":"shifu"
}
```

## Offset

**Parameter**: `offset`
**Expected value**: any positive integer
**Default value**: `0`

Sets the starting point in the search results, effectively skipping over a given number of documents.

::: tip
This parameter can be used together with `limit` in order to paginate results.
:::

### Example

If you want to skip the **first** result in a query, set `offset` to `1`:

<CodeSamples id="search_parameter_guide_offset_1" />

## Limit

**Parameter**: `limit`
**Expected value**: any positive integer
**Default value**: `20`

Sets the maximum number of documents returned by a single query.

::: tip
This parameter is often used together with `offset` in order to paginate results.
:::

### Example

If you want your query to return only **two** documents, set `limit` to `2`:

<CodeSamples id="search_parameter_guide_limit_1" />

## Filters

**Parameter**: `filters`
**Expected value**: a string containing a query expression
**Default value**: `null`

Filters query results. The string value must use MeiliSearch's [filter syntaxes](/reference/features/filtering.md#the-query-language).

### Example

You can filter your search so it only returns results whose `title` field has the value `Nightshift`:

<CodeSamples id="search_parameter_guide_filter_1" />

## Facet filters

**Parameter**: `facetFilters`
**Expected value**: an array of strings in the following format: `facetName:facetValue`
**Default value**: `null`

Uses [facets](/reference/features/faceted_search.md) to filter search results.

Values must be given as an array of strings: `facetFilters=["facetName:facetValue"]`.

These strings must be `facetName:facetValue` pairs. `facetName` corresponds to a faceted attribute and `facetValue` to the value the query results will be filtered on.

You can use nested arrays: `facetFilters=["facetName:facetValue", ["facetNameA:facetValueA", "facetNameB:facetValueB"]]`.

Facet filters also support logical connectives by using [inner and outer array elements](/reference/features/faceted_search.md#using-facets). You can [learn more about faceted search in our dedicated guide](/reference/features/faceted_search.md).

### Example

Suppose you are searching for movies, but only want results in `Horror` or `Mystery` `genres` and whose `director` is `Jordan Peele`:

```SQL
("genres:Horror" OR "genres:Mystery") AND "director:Jordan Peele"
```

After declaring `director` and `genres` as [faceted attributes](/reference/features/settings.md#attributes-for-faceting), you make a query for `thriller`:

<CodeSamples id="faceted_search_walkthrough_facet_filters_1" />

And get the following response:

```json
{
  "hits": [
    {
      "id": 458723,
      "title": "Us",
      "director": "Jordan Peele",
      "tagline": "Watch yourself",
      "genres": [
        "Thriller",
        "Horror",
        "Mystery"
      ],
      "overview": "Husband and wife Gabe and Adelaide Wilson take their kids to their beach house expecting to unplug and unwind with friends. But as night descends, their serenity turns to tension and chaos when some shocking visitors arrive uninvited.",
    },
    {
      "id": 419430,
      "title": "Get Out",
      "director": "Jordan Peele",
      "genres": [
        "Mystery",
        "Thriller",
        "Horror"
      ],
      "overview": "Chris and his girlfriend Rose go upstate to visit her parents for the weekend. At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined.",
    }
  ],
  …
  "query": "thriller"
}
```

## Facets distribution

**Parameter**: `facetsDistribution`
**Expected value**: an array of `facetName`s or `["*"]`
**Default value**: `null`

Returns the number of documents matching the current search query for each given facet.

This argument can take two values:

- An array of `facetName`s—this will only count the listed facets:  `facetsDistribution=[<facetNameA>, <facetNameB>, ...]`. If a `facetName` does not exist, it will be ignored

- An asterisk—this will return a count for all facets defined in `attributesForFaceting`.

### Returned fields

When `facetsDistribution` is set, search results contain **two additional fields**:

- `facetsDistribution`: The number of remaining candidates for each specified facet

- `exhaustiveFacetsCount`: A `true` or `false` value indicating whether the count is exact (`true`) or approximate (`false`).

When `exhaustiveFacetsCount` is false, it is because the search matches contain too many different values for the given `facetName`s. In this case, MeiliSearch stops the distribution count to prevent slowing down the request.

[Learn more about facet distribution in the dedicated guide.](/reference/features/faceted_search.md#the-facets-distribution)

### Example

Given a movie database, suppose that you want to know the number of `Batman` movies per genre:

<CodeSamples id="faceted_search_facets_distribution_1" />

You would get the following response:

```json
{
  "hits": [
    …
  ],
  …
  "nbHits": 1684,
  "query": "Batman",
  "exhaustiveFacetsCount": true,
  "facetsDistribution": {
    "genres": {
      "action": 273,
      "animation": 118,
      "adventure": 132,
      "fantasy": 67,
      "comedy": 475,
      "mystery": 70,
      "thriller": 217,
    }
  }
}
```

## Attributes to retrieve

**Parameter**: `attributesToRetrieve`
**Expected value**: an array of `attribute`s or `["*"]`
**Default value**: `["*"]`

Configures which attributes will be retrieved in the returned documents.

If no value is specified, `attributesToRetrieve` uses the [`displayedAttributes` list](/reference/features/settings.md#displayed-attributes), which by default contains all attributes found in the documents.

### Example

To get only the `overview` and `title` fields, set `attributesToRetrieve` to `["overview", "title"]`.

<CodeSamples id="search_parameter_guide_retrieve_1" />

## Attributes to crop

**Parameter**: `attributesToCrop`
**Expected value**: an array of <clientGlossary word="attribute" label="attributes" /> or `["*"]`
**Default value**: `null`

Crops the selected attributes' values in the returned results to the length indicated by the [`cropLength`](/reference/features/search_parameters.md#crop-length) parameter.

When this parameter is set, a field called `_formatted` will be added to `hits`. The cropped version of each document will be available there.

Optionally, you can indicate a custom crop length for any of the listed attributes: `attributesToCrop=["attributeNameA:25", "attributeNameB:150"]`. The custom crop length set in this way has priority over the `cropLength` parameter.

Instead of supplying individual `attributes`, you can provide `["*"]` as a value: `attributesToCrop=["*"]`. This will crop the values of all attributes present in [`attributesToRetrieve`](#attributes-to-retrieve).

**Cropping starts at the first occurrence of the search query**. It only keeps `cropLength` characters on each side of the first match, rounded to match word boundaries.

If no query word is present in the cropped field, the crop will start from the first word.

### Example

If you use `shifu` as a search query and set the value of the `cropLength` parameter to `10`:

<CodeSamples id="search_parameter_guide_crop_1" />

You will get the following response with the **cropped text in the `_formatted` object**:

```json
{
  "id": "50393",
  "title": "Kung Fu Panda Holiday",
  "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/gp18R42TbSUlw9VnXFqyecm52lq.jpg",
  "overview": "The Winter Feast is Po's favorite holiday. Every year he and his father hang decorations, cook together, and serve noodle soup to the villagers. But this year Shifu informs Po that as Dragon Warrior, it is his duty to host the formal Winter Feast at the Jade Palace. Po is caught between his obligations as the Dragon Warrior and his family traditions: between Shifu and Mr. Ping.",
  "release_date": 1290729600,
  "_formatted": {
    "id": "50393",
    "title": "Kung Fu Panda Holiday",
    "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/gp18R42TbSUlw9VnXFqyecm52lq.jpg",
    "overview": "this year Shifu informs",
    "release_date": 1290729600
  }
}
```

## Crop length

**Parameter**: `cropLength`
**Expected value**: a positive integer
**Default value**: `200`

Configures the number of characters to keep on each side of the matching query term when using the [`attributesToCrop`](/reference/features/search_parameters.md#attributes-to-crop) parameter. Note that this means there can be up to `2 * cropLength` characters in the cropped field.

If `attributesToCrop` is not configured, `cropLength` has no effect on the returned results.

## Attributes to highlight

**Parameter**: `attributesToHighlight`
**Expected value**: an array of <clientGlossary word="attribute" label="attributes" /> or `["*"]`
**Default value**: `null`

Highlights matching query terms in the given attributes. When this parameter is set, the `_formatted` object is added to the response for each document, within which you can find the highlighted text.

Values can be supplied as an array of attributes: `attributesToHighlight=["attributeA", "attributeB"]`.

Alternatively, you can provide `["*"]` as a value: `attributesToHighlight=["*"]`. In this case, all the attributes present in `attributesToRetrieve` will be assigned to `attributesToHighlight`.

::: tip
The highlighting performed by this parameter consists of wrapping matching query terms in `<em>` tags. Neither this tag nor this behavior can be modified.

If a different type of highlighting is desired, we recommend [the `matches` parameter](#matches), which provides much finer control over the output.
:::

### Example

If you wanted to highlight query matches that appear within the `overview` attribute:

<CodeSamples id="search_parameter_guide_highlight_1" />

You would get the following response with the **highlighted version in the `_formatted` object**:

```json
{
  "id": "50393",
  "title": "Kung Fu Panda Holiday",
  "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/gp18R42TbSUlw9VnXFqyecm52lq.jpg",
  "overview": "The Winter Feast is Po's favorite holiday. Every year he and his father hang decorations, cook together, and serve noodle soup to the villagers. But this year Shifu informs Po that as Dragon Warrior, it is his duty to host the formal Winter Feast at the Jade Palace. Po is caught between his obligations as the Dragon Warrior and his family traditions: between Shifu and Mr. Ping.",
  "release_date": 1290729600,
  "_formatted": {
    "id": "50393",
    "title": "Kung Fu Panda Holiday",
    "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/gp18R42TbSUlw9VnXFqyecm52lq.jpg",
    "overview": "The Winter Feast is Po's favorite holiday. Every year he and his father hang decorations, cook together, and serve noodle soup to the villagers. But this year <em>Shifu</em> informs Po that as Dragon Warrior, it is his duty to host the formal Winter Feast at the Jade Palace. Po is caught between his obligations as the Dragon Warrior and his family traditions: between <em>Shifu</em> and Mr. Ping.",
    "release_date": 1290729600
  }
}
```

## Matches

**Parameter**: `matches`
**Expected value**: `true` or `false`
**Default value**: `false`

Adds an object to the search response (`_matchesInfo`) containing the location of each occurrence of queried terms across all fields. This is useful when you need more control than offered by our [built-in highlighting](#attributes-to-highlight).

The beginning of a matching term within a field is indicated by `start`, and its length by `length`.

::: warning
`start` and `length` are measured in bytes and not the number of characters. For example, `ü` represents two bytes but one character.
:::

### Example

If you set `matches` to `true` and search for `shifu`:

<CodeSamples id="search_parameter_guide_matches_1" />

You would get the following response with **information about the matches in the `_matchesInfo` object**:

```json
{
  "id": "50393",
  "title": "Kung Fu Panda Holiday",
  "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/gp18R42TbSUlw9VnXFqyecm52lq.jpg",
  "overview": "The Winter Feast is Po's favorite holiday. Every year he and his father hang decorations, cook together, and serve noodle soup to the villagers. But this year Shifu informs Po that as Dragon Warrior, it is his duty to host the formal Winter Feast at the Jade Palace. Po is caught between his obligations as the Dragon Warrior and his family traditions: between Shifu and Mr. Ping.",
  "release_date": 1290729600,
  "_matchesInfo": {
    "overview": [
      {
        "start": 159,
        "length": 5
      },
      {
        "start": 361,
        "length": 5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
