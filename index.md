# MeiliSearch Documentation

Welcome to the MeiliSearch documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to learn and create with our **lightning fast search engine**.

[<linkButton text="üîé WHAT IS MEILISEARCH?"/>](/learn/what_is_meilisearch)

If you're looking for information on a specific MeiliSearch SDK or front-end integration, check out our [comprehensive list](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/sdks.md).

## Same Content, New Organization

Hold up--something seems different around here.

While it might look similar, our documentation has been reorganized to promote **clarity**, **browsability**, and **maintainability**. Though we made an effort to preserve any information that was here before, you may find that some things are not where they used to be.

For starters, our helpful content is now grouped into three categories:

- [Learn](/learn): If it's your **first-time using MeiliSearch** or you want a refresher, we recommend starting here.
- [Create](/create): If you're looking to start your own MeiliSearch project or get answers to a question, this is where you'll find **useful guides**, **inspiring community projects**, and **answers to all your questions**.
- [Reference](/reference): **Encyclopedia-style documentation** for all of MeiliSearch's features, API, and search engine internals. If you just want the facts and none of the fluff, this is the place for you.

::: note
This [documentation is completely open-source](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation). We keep it up-to-date but you might find some typos or mistakes. Help us make it a better guide by submitting a pull request or [an issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues) üòÅ
