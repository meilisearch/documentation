# MeiliSearch Documentation

Welcome to the MeiliSearch documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to learn and create with our **lightning fast search engine**.

[<linkButton text="ðŸ”Ž WHAT IS MEILISEARCH?"/>](/learn/what_is_meilisearch)

If you're looking for information on a specific MeiliSearch SDK or front-end integration, check out our [comprehensive list](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/sdks.md).

## Same Content, New Organization

Hold up--something seems different around here.

While it might look similar, our documentation has been revamped to improve its **clarity**, **browsability**, and **maintainability**. Though we made an effort to preserve any information that was here before, you may find that some things are not where they used to be.

For starters, our helpful content is now grouped into three categories:

- [Learn](/learn): If it's your **first-time using MeiliSearch** or you want a refresher, we recommend **starting here**.
- [Create](/create): If you already know the basics of MeiliSearch but could use some help **starting or continuing your own project**, this is where you'll find dozens of **useful guides**, **inspiring community projects**, and **answers to all your questions**.
- [Reference](/reference): **Encyclopedia-style documentation** for all of MeiliSearch's features, API, and search engine internals. If you just want the facts and none of the fluff, this is the place for you.

Since this is a new resource, it's possible that you will encounter bugs or broken links. We would love [your feedback](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues) on it.
