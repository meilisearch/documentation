MeiliSearch is a **RESTful search API**. It aims to be a **ready-to-go solution** for everyone who wants a **fast and relevant search experience** for their end-users ‚ö°Ô∏èüîé

Efficient search engines often require a significant investment of resources. They are only accessible to companies with the means necessary to develop a bespoke search solution that fits their needs.

Small to medium sized businesses commonly resort to subpar search engines that incur invisible costs on their user experience and retention due to poor search fulfillment.

That's why we created MeiliSearch: An open source solution accessible to everyone, designed to meet a vast majority of needs. Requiring very little configuration to be installed, yet highly customizable.

Our solution delivers an **instant search experience**; it handles **typos**; it understands **filters**, **custom rankings**, and many other [features](#features).

## Alternatives

Why should you use MeiliSearch instead of any other existing solution? We try to answer this question in this [comparison to alternatives](/resources/comparison_to_alternatives.md). In short, Meili most closely compares with Algolia. Meili stands out by being open source (while commercial) and aims to be simpler to deploy and maintain.
