# MeiliSearch Documentation

Welcome to the MeiliSearch documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to learn and create with our **lightning fast search engine**.

[<linkButton text="🚀 GETTING STARTED"/>](/learn/tutorials/getting_started)

If you're looking for information on a specific MeiliSearch SDK or front-end integration, you'll find it in our [SDK list](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/sdks.md).

## Getting Started

**Enjoy a hands-on approach to learning**? Follow a [quick tutorial](/learn/tutorials/getting_started.md) to learn the basics of the engine.

**Prefer to learn by reading**? You're not alone. Check out articles covering the most important [core concepts](/learn/core_concepts) of MeiliSearch.

## Version Compatibility

This documentation only reflects the latest version of MeiliSearch. We do not provide multi-version documentation.
The current version of [MeiliSearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch) can be found on the left side of the upper navbar.

## Same Docs; New Organization

Hold up a minute—is it just me, or is something different here? 🤔

Our documentation has been reorganized to promote **clarity**, **browsability**, and **maintainability**. For starters, our helpful content is now grouped into **three categories**:

- [Learn](/learn): If it's your **first-time using MeiliSearch** or you want a refresher, we recommend starting here.

- [Create](/create): If you're looking to **start your own MeiliSearch project** or get answers to a question, this is the place.

- [Reference](/reference): **Encyclopedia-style documentation** for all of MeiliSearch's [features](/reference/features), [API](/reference/api), and [search engine internals](/reference/under_the_hood). If you just want the facts and none of the fluff, you'll like it here.

Have fun browsing the new site, and let us know [what you think could be improved](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues/new).

Happy searching! 🖖
