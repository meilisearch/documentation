### Testing

```

The tests are triggered on build and on any pull request to master.

#### Checking dead links

Making changes to the documentation without creating any dead links can be a tedious task. Before submitting any pull request, you can check the dead links.

```bash
$ yarn check-links
```

#### Checking Styling

The documentation follows styling rules. The following files will be checked: `*.vue`, `*.js`, and `*.md`.

You can check out and fix the styling errors.

```bash
$ yarn style:fix
```

You can test if the code is well-formatted without fixing it.

```bash
$ yarn check-style
```

### Deployment

The documentation is deployed as a static website. The master branch is automatically deployed at [https://docs.meilisearch.com](https://docs.meilisearch.com).

You can build the static website using the following command:

```bash
$ yarn build
# The website is now available in .vuepress/dist and you can serve it using any webserver.
```
