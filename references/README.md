The documentation is written for the latest stable release: [v0.9.0](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/releases/tag/v0.9.0).

:::

## Headers

### Recommended Headers

#### Content Type

All request and response body are in `JSON`. Always specify it in your header.

`Content-Type: application/json`

#### Authentication

For almost all routes, you need to be recognized by the server to check your permissions. Add your API key to your headers.
Please read the [advanced part about keys](/guides/advanced_guides/keys.md) and [how to manage them](/references/keys.md) for more information.

`X-Meili-API-Key: $API_KEY`

## Errors & Status Code

#### Success

**200 - Ok**: Everything worked as expected.

**201 - Created**: The resource has been created (synchronous)

**202 - Accepted**: The update has been pushed in the update queue (asynchronous)

**204 - No Content**: The resource has been deleted or no content has been returned

**205 - Reset Content**: All the resources have been deleted

#### Error

**400 - Bad Request**: The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.

**401 - Unauthorized**: No valid API key provided.

**403 - Forbidden**: The API key doesn't have the permissions to perform the request.

**404 - Not Found**: The requested resource doesn't exist.

All errors contain a `JSON` body that explains the error.

Response body:
```json
{
  "message": "The error message"
}
```

## Asynchronous Updates

MeiliSearch is an **asynchronous API**. It means that, in a lot of cases, you will receive as server response a simple JSON with only an `updateId` attribute:

```json
{
    "updateId": 2
}
```

This kind of successful response indicates that the operation has been taken into account, but it may not have been executed yet.<br>
You can check the status of the operation via the `updateId` and the [get update status route](/references/updates.md).

See more information about [asynchronous updates](/guides/advanced_guides/asynchronous_updates.md).
