---

The Meilisearch platform provides everything you need to run search in production: managed cloud infrastructure, team collaboration, security and access control, and operational monitoring.

## Meilisearch Cloud

Meilisearch Cloud is the fully managed way to run Meilisearch. It handles infrastructure, scaling, backups, and upgrades so you can focus on building great search experiences.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dedicated resources** | Your own CPU, RAM, and storage—no multi-tenancy |
| **Global regions** | Deploy close to your users for low latency |
| **Zero-downtime upgrades** | Dumpless upgrades complete in seconds |
| **Automatic backups** | Data protection with configurable retention |
| **SOC 2 Type 2** | Enterprise-grade security certification |

See [Infrastructure](/products/platform/infrastructure) for regions, architecture, and backups. See [Billing](/products/platform/billing) for pricing and payments.

## Teams and collaboration

Meilisearch Cloud uses **teams** to organize resources and collaboration. On standard plans, teams are the top-level entity with their own billing. Enterprise customers can use **organizations** to manage multiple teams with consolidated billing.

### Team roles

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| **Owner** | Full access including billing and team management |
| **Member** | Project access, cannot manage billing or team |

## Security and API keys

Meilisearch uses API keys to authenticate requests and control access.

    Multi-tenant access control
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Key types

| Key type | Purpose | Safe for client-side? |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| **Admin API key** | Server-side operations (indexing, settings) | No |
| **Search API key** | Search operations only | Yes |
| **Chat API key** | Conversational search | Yes |

### Tenant tokens

For multi-tenant applications, generate scoped tokens that restrict access:

```javascript
const token = client.generateTenantToken(
  searchKey.uid,
  { filter: `tenant_id = ${tenantId}` },
  { expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 3600000) }
);
```

## Batches and tasks

Meilisearch processes operations asynchronously. Understanding batches is key to monitoring and optimizing your search infrastructure.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Webhooks" icon="webhook" href="/products/platform/webhooks">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Batches vs tasks

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Batch** | A group of tasks processed together (primary unit of work) |
| **Task** | A single operation (add documents, update settings, etc.) |

The Meilisearch Cloud dashboard provides rich batch visualization including operation timelines, storage changes, and performance metrics.

### Quick task check

```bash
# Get task status
curl "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/tasks/42" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}"
```

## Quick reference

### Common operations

```bash
# List API keys
curl "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/keys" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}"

# List recent batches
curl "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/batches?limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}"

# List recent tasks
curl "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/tasks?limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}"

# Cancel pending tasks
curl -X POST "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/tasks/cancel?statuses=enqueued" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}"
```
