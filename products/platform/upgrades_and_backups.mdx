Meilisearch Cloud handles upgrades and backups automatically, keeping your search infrastructure up-to-date and protected with minimal effort.

## Zero-downtime upgrades

Meilisearch Cloud supports one-click upgrades that keep your project available throughout the process.

### How upgrades work

1. Click "Upgrade" in your project settings
2. Meilisearch prepares the new version
3. Your project switches to the new version with minimal interruption
4. The upgrade completes in seconds to minutes

### Dumpless upgrades

Traditional upgrades require exporting all data (creating a dump) and re-importing it into the new version. This is slow for large datasets.

**Dumpless upgrades** are a Meilisearch innovation that:
- Only recompute what changed between versions
- Complete in seconds, not hours
- Work even with millions of documents
- Keep your project available during the process

| Upgrade type | Time for 10M documents | Downtime |
|--------------|------------------------|----------|
| Traditional (with dump) | Hours | Significant |
| Dumpless | Seconds to minutes | Minimal to none |

### When to upgrade

- **Security updates**: Apply promptly for security patches
- **New features**: Upgrade when you need new capabilities
- **Performance improvements**: Benefit from engine optimizations

<Tip>
Enable automatic upgrades in project settings to stay current automatically, or manually upgrade when convenient for your deployment schedule.
</Tip>

### Upgrade notifications

Meilisearch Cloud notifies you when new versions are available:
- Email notifications
- Dashboard banners
- Release notes with changes

## Automatic backups

Meilisearch Cloud automatically backs up your data to protect against data loss.

### How backups work

1. Meilisearch creates periodic snapshots of your data
2. Snapshots are stored securely in the same region
3. Backups can be restored by contacting support

### Backup schedule

| Plan | Frequency | Retention |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Standard | Weekly | Last 2 backups |
| Enterprise | Customizable | Customizable |

<Note>
Enterprise customers can configure backup frequency (daily, hourly) and retention period based on their requirements.
</Note>

### What's backed up

Backups include:
- All indexed documents
- Index settings and configuration
- API keys and permissions

### Restoring from backup

To restore from a backup:
1. Contact Meilisearch support
2. Specify the backup date/time to restore
3. Choose whether to restore to the same project or a new one

<Warning>
Restoring from backup replaces current data. Consider creating a new project for restoration if you need to preserve current state.
</Warning>

## Data protection best practices

### For production workloads

- **Enable automatic backups**: Already enabled by default
- **Test restoration**: Periodically verify backups work
- **Document your setup**: Keep records of custom settings

### For critical applications

- **Enterprise backup schedule**: More frequent backups
- **Multiple environments**: Separate dev/staging/prod projects
- **External backups**: Consider additional backups to your own storage

## Manual snapshots (Self-hosted)

For self-hosted Meilisearch, you can create manual snapshots:

```bash
curl -X POST "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/snapshots" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}"
```

This creates a point-in-time snapshot that can be used for:
- Backup before risky operations
- Migration to new infrastructure
- Disaster recovery

<Note>
Manual snapshots are primarily for self-hosted installations. Meilisearch Cloud handles backups automatically.
</Note>

## Disaster recovery

Meilisearch Cloud provides multiple layers of protection:

| Layer | Protection against |
|-------|-------------------|
| **EBS storage** | Disk failures |
| **Kubernetes failover** | Node failures |
| **Automatic backups** | Data corruption, accidental deletion |
| **Regional redundancy** | Availability zone failures |

### Recovery time objectives

| Scenario | Typical recovery time |
|----------|----------------------|
| Node failure | Minutes (automatic) |
| Restore from backup | Hours (contact support) |

## Version management

### Checking current version

View your project's Meilisearch version in the dashboard:

### Version compatibility

When upgrading:
- Data format is preserved across versions
- API compatibility is maintained within major versions
- Breaking changes are documented in release notes

### Rollback

If issues occur after upgrade:
1. Contact Meilisearch support
2. Describe the issue
3. Support can assist with rollback if needed

<Note>
Dumpless upgrades make rollbacks rare since upgrades are fast and low-risk.
