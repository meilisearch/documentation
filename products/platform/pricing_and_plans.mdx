Meilisearch Cloud offers two pricing models: **usage-based** for flexibility and **resource-based** for predictable costs. Both provide fully managed infrastructure with enterprise-grade reliability.

## Pricing models compared

| | Usage-based | Resource-based |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| **Billing** | Pay for searches and documents | Pay for CPU, RAM, and storage |
| **Scaling** | Automatic | Manual (choose your resources) |
| **Best for** | Variable traffic, MVPs, prototypes | High traffic, predictable workloads |
| **Cost predictability** | Variable (based on usage) | Fixed (based on resources) |
| **Starting price** | $30/month | Custom |

## Usage-based plans

Usage-based pricing charges based on what you actually use:

- **Searches**: Number of search queries
- **Documents**: Number of stored documents

### How it works

1. Choose a plan tier with included searches and documents
2. If you exceed the included limits, pay overage rates
3. Infrastructure scales automatically

### Benefits

- **Start small**: Begin with minimal commitment
- **Scale automatically**: Resources grow with your traffic
- **Pay for what you use**: No paying for idle capacity

### Best for

- Prototypes and MVPs
- Applications with variable or unpredictable traffic
- Teams testing Meilisearch before committing

## Resource-based plans

Resource-based pricing lets you choose specific CPU, RAM, and storage:

### How it works

1. Select your CPU and RAM allocation
2. Disk scales automatically based on data volume
3. Pay a fixed monthly price for your resources

### Benefits

- **Predictable costs**: Know your bill in advance
- **Dedicated resources**: Guaranteed performance
- **No surprise charges**: No overage billing

### Best for

- Production applications with consistent traffic
- High-traffic applications
- Vector search and AI workloads
- Applications requiring cost predictability

### Resource sizing guidance

| Workload | Recommended starting point |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Small (< 100K docs, light traffic) | 1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM |
| Medium (< 1M docs, moderate traffic) | 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM |
| Large (< 10M docs, high traffic) | 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM |
| Vector search / AI workloads | 4+ vCPU, 16+ GB RAM |

<Tip>
For development and staging environments, you can use smaller instances to reduce costs. Reserve larger instances for production where performance matters.
