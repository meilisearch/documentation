## Total searches

Total number of searches made during the specified period. Multi-search and federated search requests count as a single search.

## Total users

Total number of users who performed a search in the specified period.

Include the [user ID](/products/analytics/bind_events_user) in your search request headers for the most accurate metrics. If search requests do not provide any user ID, the total amount of unique users will increase, as each request is assigned to a unique user ID.

## No result rate

Percentage of searches that did not return any results.

## Click-through rate

The ratio between the number of times users clicked on a result and the number of times Meilisearch showed that result. Since users will click on results that potentially match what they were looking for, a higher number indicates better relevancy.

Meilisearch does not have access to this information by default. You must [configure your application to submit click events](/products/analytics/track_click_events) to Meilisearch if you want to track it in the Meilisearch Cloud interface.

## Average click position

The average list position of clicked search results. A lower number means users have clicked on the first search results and indicates good relevancy.

Meilisearch does not have access to this information by default. You must [configure your application to submit click events](/products/analytics/track_click_events) to Meilisearch if you want to track it in the Meilisearch Cloud interface.

## Conversion

The percentage of searches resulting in a conversion event in your application. Conversion events vary depending on your application and indicate a user has performed a specific desired action. For example, a conversion for an e-commerce website might mean a user has bought a product.

You must explicitly [configure your application to send conversion](/products/analytics/track_click_events) events when conditions are met.

<Note>
It is not possible to associate multiple `conversion` events with the same query.
</Note>

## Search requests

Total number of search requests within the specified time period.

## Search latency

The amount of time between a user making a search request and Meilisearch Cloud returning search results. A lower number indicates users receive search results more quickly.

## Most searched queries

Most common query terms users have used while searching.

## Searches without results

Most common query terms that did not return any search results.

## Countries with most searches

List of countries that generate the largest amount of search requests.
