Meilisearch supports several query syntax features that give you fine-grained control over search results. This guide covers normalization, placeholder search, phrase search, and negative search.

## Query term normalization

Query terms go through a normalization process that removes [non-spacing marks](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/category/Mn). Because of this, Meilisearch effectively ignores accents and diacritics when returning results.

For example, searching for `"sábia"` returns documents containing `"sábia"`, `"sabiá"`, and `"sabia"`.

Normalization also converts all letters to lowercase. Searching for `"Video"` returns the same results as searching for `"video"`, `"VIDEO"`, or `"viDEO"`.

## Placeholder search

When no query term is provided, Meilisearch performs a **placeholder search**. A placeholder search returns all searchable documents in an index, modified by any search parameters used and sorted by that index's [custom ranking rules](/products/full_text_search/custom_ranking_rules).

Since there is no query term, the [built-in ranking rules](/products/full_text_search/ranking_rules) **do not apply**.

If the index has no sort or custom ranking rules, results are returned in the order of their internal database position.

<Tip>
Placeholder search is particularly useful when building [faceted search interfaces](/products/faceted_search/search_with_facet_filters), as it allows users to browse the catalog and alter sorting rules without entering a query.

### Example

```bash
curl \
  -X POST "${MEILISEARCH_URL}/indexes/movies/search" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MEILISEARCH_API_KEY}" \
  --data-binary '{
    "q": "",
    "sort": ["release_date:desc"]
  }'
```

## Phrase search

Enclose search terms in double quotes (`"`) to perform a **phrase search**. Meilisearch only returns documents containing those terms in the exact order given.

Phrase searches are:
- **Case-insensitive**: `"Octavia Butler"` matches `"octavia butler"`
- **Soft separator tolerant**: ignores separators like `-`, `,`, and `:` within the phrase

Using a hard separator (like `.`) within a phrase search splits it into multiple separate phrase searches: `"Octavia.Butler"` returns the same results as `"Octavia" "Butler"`.

You can combine phrase search with normal queries in a single request. Meilisearch first fetches all documents with exact matches to the given phrase(s), then proceeds with its [default ranking behavior](/products/full_text_search/ranking_rules).

### Example

<CodeSamplesPhraseSearch1 />

## Negative search

Use the minus (`-`) operator in front of a word or phrase to **exclude** it from search results.

### Exclude a word

The following query returns all documents that do not include the word "escape":

<CodeSamplesNegativeSearch1 />

### Exclude a phrase

Negative search can be combined with phrase search to exclude exact phrases:

<CodeSamplesNegativeSearch2 />

## Query limits

Meilisearch processes a maximum of **10 words** per search query. Any words beyond this limit are ignored. This limitation ensures consistent search performance.
