Typo tolerance helps users find relevant results even when their search queries contain spelling mistakes or typos, for example, typing `phnoe` instead of `phone`. You can [configure the typo tolerance feature for each index](/reference/api/settings/typo-tolerance#update-typo-tolerance-settings).

## `enabled`

Typo tolerance is enabled by default, but you can disable it if needed:

<CodeSamplesTypoToleranceGuide1 />

With typo tolerance disabled, Meilisearch no longer considers words that are a few characters off from your query terms as matches. For example, a query for `phnoe` will no longer return a document containing the word `phone`.

**In most cases, keeping typo tolerance enabled results in a better search experience.** Massive or multilingual datasets may be exceptions, as typo tolerance can cause false-positive matches in these cases.

## `minWordSizeForTypos`

By default, Meilisearch accepts one typo for query terms containing five or more characters, and up to two typos if the term is at least nine characters long.

If your dataset contains `seven`, searching for `sevem` or `sevan` will match `seven`. But `tow` won't match `two` as it's less than `5` characters.

You can override these default settings using the `minWordSizeForTypos` object. The code sample below sets the minimum word size for one typo to `4` and the minimum word size for two typos to `10`.

<CodeSamplesTypoToleranceGuide4 />

When updating the `minWordSizeForTypos` object, keep in mind that:

- `oneTypo` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `twoTypos`
- `twoTypos` must be greater than or equal to `oneTypo` and less than or equal to `255`

To put it another way: `0 ≤ oneTypo ≤ twoTypos ≤ 255`.

We recommend keeping the value of `oneTypo` between `2` and `8` and the value of `twoTypos` between `4` and `14`. If either value is too low, you may get a large number of false-positive results. On the other hand, if both values are set too high, many search queries may not benefit from typo tolerance.

<Tip>
**Typo on the first character**  
Meilisearch considers a typo on a query's first character as two typos.

**Concatenation**  
When considering possible candidates for typo tolerance, Meilisearch will concatenate multiple search terms separated by a [space separator](/resources/internals/datatypes#string). This is treated as one typo. For example, a search for `any way` would match documents containing `anyway`.

For more about typo calculations, [see below](/products/full_text_search/typo_tolerance_calculations).
</Tip>

## `disableOnWords`

You can disable typo tolerance for a list of query terms by adding them to `disableOnWords`. `disableOnWords` is case insensitive.

<CodeSamplesTypoToleranceGuide3 />

Meilisearch won't apply typo tolerance on the query term `Shrek` or `shrek` at search time to match documents.

## `disableOnAttributes`

You can disable typo tolerance for a specific [document attribute](resources/glossary/documents) by adding it to `disableOnAttributes`. The code sample below disables typo tolerance for `title`:

<CodeSamplesTypoToleranceGuide2 />

With the above settings, matches in the `title` attribute will not tolerate any typos. For example, a search for `beautiful` (9 characters) will not match the movie "Biutiful" starring Javier Bardem. With the default settings, this would be a match.

## `disableOnNumbers`

You can disable typo tolerance for all numeric values across all indexes and search requests by setting `disableOnNumbers` to `true`:

<CodeSamplesTypoToleranceGuide5 />

By default, typo tolerance on numerical values is turned on. This may lead to false positives, such as a search for `2024` matching documents containing `2025` or `2004`.

When `disableOnNumbers` is set to `true`, queries with numbers only return exact matches. Besides reducing the number of false positives, disabling typo tolerance on numbers may also improve indexing performance.
