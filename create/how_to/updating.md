# Update to the Latest MeiliSearch Version

Currently, MeiliSearch versions [are not compatible with each other](/learn/getting_started/installation.md#updating-meilisearch). The following guide will walk you through all the steps to migrate your database from an older version of MeiliSearch to the most recent one.

If you already have a MeiliSearch database with some data you donâ€™t want to lose, you are in the right place!

## Verify your database version

Before we begin, you need to verify your database's **expected MeiliSearch version**, i.e. the version that indexed the data. You can do so by launching a MeiliSearch instance:

```bash
./meilisearch
```

If MeiliSearch launches successfully, use the [get version endpoint](/reference/api/version.md) and [proceed to the next step](#proceed-according-to-your-database-version).

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/version'
```

If you get the error `Cannot open database, expected MeiliSearch engine version: X.X.X, current engine version Y.Y.Y`, **your database is not compatible with the currently installed MeiliSearch version**. You need to download the expected version and use that instead.

::: tab cURL
If you downloaded MeiliSearch using curl, find and download the **expected version** [here](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/releases) before continuing.
:::

::: tab Homebrew

```bash
brew install meilisearch@0.X.X
```

:::

::: tab Source

```bash
# Clone MeiliSearch and checkout the branch of the expected version
git clone https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch
cd MeiliSearch
git checkout v0.X.X

# Update the rust toolchain to the latest version
rustup update

# Compile the project
cargo build --release

# Execute the server binary
./target/release/meilisearch
```

:::

::: tab APT

```bash
apt-get install meilisearch=0.X.X
```

:::

::: tab Docker

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -p 7700:7700 \
    -v $(pwd)/data.ms:/data.ms \
    getmeili/meilisearch:v0.X.X
```

## Proceed according to your database version

Now that you know the version your database is using, proceed accordingly:

- **If your database version is v0.15.0 or above**, continue to the [next section](#updating-from-v0-15-0-or-above).
- **If your version is v0.14.0 or below**, [go here](#updating-from-v0-14-0-or-below).

## Updating from v0.15.0 or above

Because MeiliSearch v0.15.0 and above include the [dumps feature](/reference/features/dumps.md), updating is very simple.

You just need to:
1. **Create a dump** using the *expected* MeiliSearch version.
2. **Import it** using the *most recent* MeiliSearch version.

### Step 1: Set all fields as displayed attributes

When creating dumps, MeiliSearch calls the same method as the [GET documents endpoint](/reference/api/documents.md#get-documents). This means that a field must be present in the [displayed attributes list](/reference/features/field_properties.md#displayed-fields) in order to be included in the dump.

By default, all fields are added to `displayedAttributes`. Still, it's a good idea to verify this before creating a dump. You can do so by using the [get displayed attributes endpoint](/reference/api/displayed_attributes.md#get-displayed-attributes):

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/indexes/:index_uid/settings/displayed-attributes'
```

If the returned value is `["*"]`, you can move on to the [next step](#step-2-create-the-dump). If not, then you need to use the [reset displayed attributes endpoint](/reference/api/displayed_attributes.md#reset-displayed-attributes).

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/indexes/:index_uid/settings/displayed-attributes'
```

### Step 2: Create the dump

Before creating your dump, verify that your [dump directory](/reference/features/configuration.md#dumps-destination) is somewhere accessible to you. By default this is a folder called `dumps` at the root of your MeiliSearch directory, but can be modified at launch.

::: tip
If you're unsure where your MeiliSearch directory is located, try this:

```bash
which meilisearch
```

:::

To create a dump, simply use the [create dump endpoint](/reference/api/dump.md#create-a-dump).

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/dumps'
```

The server should return a response that looks like this:

```json
{
  "uid": "20210212-151153878",
  "status": "in_progress"
}
```

Since dump creation is an [asynchronous process](/learn/advanced/asynchronous_updates.md), you can use the returned `uid` to [track its status](/reference/api/dump.md#get-dump-status).

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/dumps/:dump_uid/status'
```

This process can take some time. Once the status is `"done"`, move on to the next step.

### Step 3: Import the dump

Now that youâ€™ve got your dump, you just need to [install the latest version of MeiliSearch](/learn/getting_started/installation.md#download-and-launch) and import the dump at launch, like so:

```bash
# Launch MeiliSearch and import the specified dump file
./meilisearch --import-dump /dumps/your_dump_file.dump
```

> Importing a dump is the same process as indexing documents. This can take time and cause a spike in RAM usage. To save RAM, use a [smaller batch size](/reference/features/configuration.md#dump-batch-size).

Finally, donâ€™t forget to set `displayedAttributes` back to its previous value, if necessary.

Congratulations! You have successfully migrated your MeiliSearch database to the latest version! ðŸŽ‰

## Updating from v0.14.0 or below

Since these versions predate the [dumps feature](/reference/features/dumps.md), the best solution is to export your documents and your [index settings](/reference/features/settings.md) as `.JSON` files.

If you donâ€™t need to preserve index settings, skip directly to [step 2](#step-2-set-all-fields-as-displayed-attributes).

### Step 1: Save your settings

First, use the [get settings endpoint](/reference/api/settings.md#get-settings) to retrieve the [settings](/reference/features/settings.md) of any indexes you want to preserve, and save them to a file using the method you prefer.

```bash
# the -o option saves the output as a local file
curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/indexes/:index_uid/settings' -o mysettings.json
```

Repeat this process for all indexes you wish to migrate.

**It is important to save your settings before exporting documents**, since the next step may require you to modify the settings.

### Step 2: Set all fields as displayed attributes

To prevent data loss, all fields must be set as [displayed](/reference/features/field_properties.md#displayed-fields).

By default, all fields are added to the displayed attributes list. Still, it's a good idea to verify this before creating a dump. You can do so by using the [get displayed attributes endpoint](/reference/api/displayed_attributes.md#get-displayed-attributes):

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/indexes/:index_uid/settings/displayed-attributes'
```

If the returned value is `["*"]`, you can move on to the [next step](#step-2-create-the-dump). If not, then you need to use the [reset displayed-attributes endpoint](/reference/api/displayed_attributes.md#reset-displayed-attributes).

```bash
curl -X DELETE 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/indexes/:index_uid/settings/displayed-attributes'
```

Now that all fields are displayed, you can proceed to the next step.

### Step 3: Save your documents

Use the [get documents endpoint](/reference/api/documents.md#get-documents) to retrieve your documents and save them using the method you prefer. Make sure to set the `limit` parameter so that, if you have `n` documents, `limit â‰¥ n`. Otherwise, you risk data loss.

```bash
# the -o option saves the output as a local file
curl -X GET 'http://127.0.0.1:7700/indexes/:index_uid/documents?limit=n' \
  -o mydocuments.json
```

### Step 4: Upload your data to the latest version of MeiliSearch

Finally, [install the latest version of MeiliSearch](/learn/getting_started/installation.md) and upload your data as usual.

If you chose to save your settings, make sure to follow this order:

```bash
# Update your settings
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @mysettings.json \
  'http://127.0.0.1:7700/indexes/:index_uid/settings'

# Then, add your documents
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @mydocuments.json \
  'http://127.0.0.1:7700/indexes/:index_uid/documents'
```

Since updating the settings requires re-indexing all documents, this order saves time and memory.

Congratulations! You have successfully migrated your MeiliSearch database to the latest version! ðŸŽ‰
