# Postman Collection for MeiliSearch

Are you tired to use the `curl` command in your terminal to test MeiliSearch? It can be tedious to re-write every route when wanting to try out an API.

Postman is a platform that lets you create HTTP requests that you can reuse easily and share with everyone.
We provide a [Postman collection](/postman/meilisearch-collection.json) containing all the routes of the MeiliSearch API! ðŸš€

::: note
If you don't use Postman yet, you can [download it here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
It's free and available on many OS distributions.

## Import the collection

Once you downloaded the [Postman collection](/postman/meilisearch-collection.json), you need to import it into Postman.

## Edit the configuration

![Edit](/postman/edit.png)

Set the API key if needed (set to `masterKey` value by default):

![Edit API Key](/postman/set_api_key.png)

And set the host URL (works for a local machine by default) and the index UID (set to `indexUID` by default):

![Edit variables](/postman/set_variables.png)

The `url` and `indexUID` variables are used in all the collection routes, like in this one:

## Start to use it!

You can now [run your MeiliSearch instance](/guides/advanced_guides/installation.md) and create your first index:
