description: Compare Meilisearch with MongoDB Atlas Search. Learn when a dedicated search engine outperforms database-integrated search.
---

MongoDB Atlas Search integrates Apache Lucene-based full-text search directly into MongoDB Atlas. It allows searching MongoDB collections without a separate search infrastructure, using familiar MongoDB Query API syntax.

## Quick comparison

|  | Meilisearch | MongoDB Atlas Search |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| **Primary purpose** | Search engine | Database with search |
| **Typo tolerance** | Built-in | Via fuzzy matching config |
| **Search-as-you-type** | Optimized (under 50ms) | Possible but not optimized |
| **Self-hosting** | Yes | Atlas only (managed) |
| **Faceted search** | Native, optimized | Via aggregation pipeline |
| **Relevancy tuning** | Configurable ranking rules | Score modifiers |
| **Frontend libraries** | InstantSearch compatible | None |

## What MongoDB Atlas Search does well

### Unified data platform

Atlas Search eliminates the need to synchronize data between MongoDB and a separate search engine. Your search index stays automatically in sync with your documents.

### Familiar syntax

If you're already using MongoDB, Atlas Search uses the same aggregation pipeline syntax. No new query language to learn.

### Vector search support

Atlas Vector Search enables semantic search and RAG applications using vector embeddings alongside traditional search.

### Managed infrastructure

As part of Atlas, search infrastructure is fully managed with automatic scaling, backups, and monitoring.

## When to choose Meilisearch instead

### You need instant search-as-you-type

Meilisearch is architected for sub-50ms response times, essential for search-as-you-type experiences. Atlas Search, while capable, isn't optimized specifically for this use case.

### Typo tolerance is critical

Meilisearch handles typos automatically with configurable tolerance per attribute. Atlas Search requires explicit fuzzy matching configuration and doesn't provide the same level of automatic typo handling.

### You want better relevancy out-of-the-box

Meilisearch's ranking rules provide relevant results without configuration. Atlas Search requires more tuning through score modifiers to achieve similar relevancy.

### You need frontend integration

Meilisearch works with InstantSearch libraries, providing pre-built UI components for search bars, facets, and pagination. Atlas Search has no equivalent frontend ecosystem.

### Self-hosting is required

Meilisearch can be self-hosted anywhere. Atlas Search is only available on MongoDB Atlas (managed cloud), which may not meet all data sovereignty or infrastructure requirements.

### You use a different database

If your primary database isn't MongoDB, adding Atlas Search isn't an option. Meilisearch works with any data source through its REST API.

### Faceted search performance matters

Meilisearch provides optimized APIs for facet filtering and counting. Atlas Search handles facets through aggregation pipelines, which can be less efficient for complex faceted navigation.

### You're not on Atlas

Atlas Search requires MongoDB Atlas. If you're using self-hosted MongoDB or a different MongoDB hosting provider, Atlas Search isn't available.

## When to choose MongoDB Atlas Search

Consider Atlas Search if:

- You're already using MongoDB Atlas and want to minimize infrastructure
- Keeping search synchronized with your primary data is a priority
- Your team is deeply familiar with MongoDB aggregation pipelines
- Search requirements are moderate (not real-time, not highly tuned)
- You need vector search alongside your existing MongoDB documents
- Managed infrastructure is preferred over self-hosting
