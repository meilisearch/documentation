| **Cloud pricing** | From $30/month | Free 1GB tier, then usage-based |

## What Qdrant does well

### High-performance vector search

Qdrant's HNSW algorithm, optimized in Rust, delivers excellent vector search performance. Quantization can reduce memory usage significantly while maintaining accuracy.

### Filterable vector search

Qdrant's architecture integrates filtering directly into the search process rather than filtering after retrieval. This enables efficient combination of semantic similarity with metadata filters.

### Deployment flexibility

Unlike some competitors, Qdrant offers self-hosting, managed cloud, and hybrid deployment options. This flexibility supports various data sovereignty and infrastructure requirements.

### Open source

Qdrant is open-source under Apache 2.0 license, allowing inspection, modification, and self-hosting without vendor lock-in.

## When to choose Meilisearch instead

### You need strong full-text search

Meilisearch provides mature full-text search with typo tolerance, prefix matching, and sophisticated relevancy ranking. Qdrant's keyword capabilities via sparse vectors don't match the depth of a dedicated search engine.

### Typo tolerance is important

Meilisearch handles misspellings automatically with configurable tolerance. Vector search operates on embeddings of the exact query text, so typos produce different vectors and potentially different results.

### You want unified hybrid search

Meilisearch combines keyword and semantic search in a single API with adjustable balance. With Qdrant, you'd need to implement hybrid search logic yourself or use their sparse vector support.

### You prefer built-in embedding generation

Meilisearch can generate embeddings automatically through integrations with OpenAI, HuggingFace, and other providers. Qdrant requires external embedding generation before indexing and querying.

### Search relevancy tuning matters

Meilisearch offers configurable ranking rules, custom ranking attributes, and relevancy tuning out-of-the-box. Qdrant focuses on vector similarity with less flexibility for traditional relevancy adjustments.

### Your primary use case is site/app search

If you're building e-commerce search, documentation search, or general site search where keyword matching is essential, Meilisearch's full-text capabilities are more comprehensive.

## When to choose Qdrant

Consider Qdrant if:

- You're building AI applications where pure vector search is the primary requirement
- You need advanced vector operations like quantization and custom distance metrics
- You want to combine vector search with complex metadata filtering
- Your team manages embeddings externally and needs a dedicated vector store
- You require flexible deployment options including on-premises or hybrid cloud
- You're building recommendation systems based primarily on similarity matching
