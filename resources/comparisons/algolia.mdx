## What Algolia does well

### Mature e-commerce features

Algolia excels with merchandising tools, including a visual editor for drag-and-drop product positioning, rules engine for promotions, and A/B testing capabilities. These features help optimize conversion rates for online stores.

### Global infrastructure

With 16 server regions worldwide, Algolia's Distributed Search Network ensures low latency globally. This extensive coverage is beneficial for businesses operating internationally.

### Advanced analytics

Algolia provides comprehensive analytics including click-through rates, conversion tracking, and revenue attribution. The A/B testing feature allows comparing different search configurations with statistical analysis.

### AI capabilities

NeuralSearch combines traditional keyword search with semantic vector search. Dynamic Re-Ranking automatically adjusts results based on user behavior patterns.

## When to choose Meilisearch instead

### You value open-source flexibility

Meilisearch is fully open-source under the MIT license. You can inspect the code, contribute improvements, self-host without limitations, and avoid vendor lock-in. Algolia is entirely closed-source.

### You need predictable pricing

Algolia's usage-based model can lead to unexpected costs as you scale. Meilisearch Cloud offers fixed monthly pricing ($30/month for Build, $300/month for Pro), making budgeting straightforward.

### You want AI search without premium tiers

Meilisearch's hybrid search combining keyword and semantic search is available on all plans and for self-hosted deployments. Algolia restricts NeuralSearch to its highest-priced Elevate plan.

### You prefer self-hosting

Meilisearch can be self-hosted for free with full feature access. Algolia has no self-hosting option, meaning you're entirely dependent on their infrastructure and pricing decisions.

### You need simpler setup

While both platforms work well out-of-the-box, Meilisearch's API is designed for maximum simplicity. Features like sorting don't require index replication, and configuration has fewer moving parts.

### Budget is a concern

Algolia's pricing can become expensive for small-to-medium businesses. Their premium features and complex pricing model (records, searches, API operations) can lead to higher total costs than anticipated.

## When to choose Algolia

Consider Algolia if:

- You need sophisticated e-commerce merchandising with visual editors and A/B testing
- You require 16+ global server regions for international deployments
- You have the budget for premium features and usage-based pricing
- You prefer a fully managed service without any self-hosting requirements
- You need advanced personalization based on user behavior tracking
- Your team can dedicate resources to implementation and optimization
