## What Typesense does well

### Field weighting

Typesense allows boosting specific fields for increased relevancy. You can ensure matches in product titles rank higher than description matches. Meilisearch offers similar capabilities through searchable attributes ordering and is adding field boosting support.

### Grouping results

Typesense provides the ability to group search results by a specified field, useful for deduplication or organizing results by category.

### Memory-optimized performance

By storing indexes entirely in RAM, Typesense achieves excellent search speeds for datasets that fit in memory. This is particularly beneficial when rapid response times are critical.

### Geospatial and faceted search

Typesense offers advanced configurations for location-based services and complex product filtering, making it popular for e-commerce applications.

## When to choose Meilisearch instead

### You need robust language support

Meilisearch provides optimized support for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hebrew, Arabic, and other languages requiring complex tokenization. Typesense's Unicode-based tokenization struggles with languages without conventional word spacing or morphologically rich languages.

### Automatic language detection matters

Meilisearch automatically detects document language and applies appropriate tokenization. With Typesense, you need to manually specify the language or implement detection client-side.

### Your dataset exceeds available RAM

Meilisearch uses disk storage with memory mapping, meaning your dataset size isn't limited by RAM. Typesense stores indexes entirely in memory, which can become costly or impractical for large datasets.

### You want built-in AI search

Meilisearch handles embedding generation through integrations with OpenAI, HuggingFace, and other providers. Typesense requires you to generate and manage embeddings externally.

### You prefer MIT licensing

Meilisearch uses the permissive MIT license. Typesense uses GPL-3, which has more restrictions for commercial use and derivative works.

### You need comprehensive analytics

Meilisearch Cloud provides detailed search analytics including no-result rates, popular queries, and geographic distribution. Typesense offers basic query popularity tracking.

## When to choose Typesense

Consider Typesense if:

- Field weighting for relevancy is critical for your use case
- You need to group search results by field values
- Your dataset fits comfortably in RAM and you want memory-optimized performance
- You're building location-based services with complex geospatial queries
- GPL-3 licensing aligns with your project requirements
