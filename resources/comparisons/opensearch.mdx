OpenSearch is an open-source search and analytics suite derived from Elasticsearch 7.10.2. Created by AWS in 2021 after Elastic changed Elasticsearch's license, OpenSearch maintains compatibility with the Elasticsearch API while being fully open-source under Apache 2.0.

## Quick comparison

|  | Meilisearch | OpenSearch |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| **Primary focus** | Fast, relevant search | Search & analytics platform |
| **License** | MIT | Apache 2.0 |
| **Setup complexity** | Ready in minutes | Steep learning curve |
| **Performance** | Under 50ms out-of-the-box | Requires tuning |
| **Resource usage** | Lightweight | Memory-intensive |
| **Architecture** | Single-node (enterprise clustering) | Distributed clusters |
| **Best for** | App/site search | Large-scale analytics |

## What OpenSearch does well

### Truly open source

OpenSearch is fully open-source under Apache 2.0 with no proprietary components. AWS maintains the project with community governance, ensuring no licensing surprises.

### Elasticsearch compatibility

OpenSearch maintains API compatibility with Elasticsearch 7.x, making migration straightforward for existing Elasticsearch users. Most Elasticsearch tooling and knowledge transfers directly.

### Distributed architecture

Like Elasticsearch, OpenSearch scales horizontally across clusters for petabyte-scale deployments. The shard-based architecture supports massive data volumes.

### Analytics capabilities

OpenSearch includes dashboards (fork of Kibana), aggregations, and analytics features suitable for log analysis, observability, and business intelligence use cases.

### AWS integration

OpenSearch Service on AWS provides managed hosting with tight integration into the AWS ecosystem, including IAM, VPC, and CloudWatch.

## When to choose Meilisearch instead

### You need search that works immediately

Meilisearch delivers relevant, typo-tolerant search results without configuration. OpenSearch, like Elasticsearch, requires understanding analyzers, mappings, and query DSL to achieve similar relevancy.

### You want minimal operational overhead

OpenSearch cluster management requires expertise in shards, replicas, and distributed systems. Meilisearch runs as a single binary with no external dependencies.

### Your team lacks search expertise

OpenSearch inherits Elasticsearch's complexity. The Query DSL has a steep learning curve, and optimal configuration requires significant experience. Meilisearch's intuitive API can be learned quickly.

### You need predictable resource usage

OpenSearch is memory-intensive and requires careful capacity planning. Meilisearch's efficient architecture provides consistent performance with lower resource requirements.

### Your dataset is under 500 million documents

For typical application search, OpenSearch's distributed architecture adds unnecessary complexity. Meilisearch handles most use cases on a single server with consistent sub-50ms responses.

### You're building end-user search

OpenSearch is designed for backend search and analytics. Meilisearch is built specifically for user-facing instant search with features like typo tolerance and search-as-you-type.

## When to choose OpenSearch

Consider OpenSearch if:

- You're migrating from Elasticsearch and need API compatibility
- You need distributed search across petabytes of data
- You're building log analytics, observability, or SIEM solutions
- You require complex aggregations and analytics beyond search
- You want tight AWS integration through OpenSearch Service
- You have teams with existing Elasticsearch expertise
