</Info>

This e-commerce demo showcases a production-ready search experience for online stores. It demonstrates advanced filtering capabilities including disjunctive facets, price range sliders, star ratings, and pagination.

## Features demonstrated

- **Disjunctive facets**: Select multiple values within a category (e.g., multiple brands)
- **Range filtering**: Price sliders for min/max filtering
- **Star ratings**: Filter products by customer ratings
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large result sets
- **Category refinement**: Hierarchical category navigation
- **Instant results**: Real-time search as you type

## Use case

E-commerce search requires sophisticated filtering that goes beyond simple text matching:

- Customers search by product name, brand, or description
- Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- Price ranges help budget-conscious shoppers
- Ratings help identify quality products
- Facet counts show available options

## Technical highlights

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Facet type | Disjunctive (OR within category, AND between categories) |
| Price filter | Numeric range with `_geoRadius` equivalent for prices |
| Sorting | By relevance, price (asc/desc), rating, newest |
| Pagination | Offset-based with configurable page size |

## Example filter expression

```
(brand = "Nike" OR brand = "Adidas") AND price 50 TO 200 AND rating >= 4
```
