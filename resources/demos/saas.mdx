This SaaS demo showcases app-wide search in a CRM context, searching simultaneously across contacts, companies, deals, and activities using Meilisearch's federated search capabilities.

## Features demonstrated

- **Multi-index search**: Query multiple data types in a single request
- **Federated results**: Unified search results from different indexes
- **Result grouping**: Results organized by entity type
- **Quick navigation**: Jump directly to contacts, companies, or deals
- **Universal search bar**: Single search input for entire application

## Use case

SaaS applications often need to search across multiple data types:

- A salesperson searches for "Acme" and sees matching companies, contacts at those companies, and related deals
- Results are grouped logically so users can quickly find what they need
- Each result type has appropriate metadata displayed
- Clicking a result navigates to the relevant section

## Technical highlights

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Search type | Federated multi-search |
| Indexes | Contacts, Companies, Deals, Activities |
| Result merging | Weighted by index relevance |
| Display | Type-specific result cards |

## Multi-search request example

```json
{
  "federation": {},
  "queries": [
    { "indexUid": "contacts", "q": "acme" },
    { "indexUid": "companies", "q": "acme" },
    { "indexUid": "deals", "q": "acme" }
  ]
}
```
