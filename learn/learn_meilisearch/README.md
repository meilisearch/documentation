# Learn MeiliSearch

MeiliSearch has been developed to provide an easily integrated search solution. Each step of the implementation process has been designed to be **as simple as possible**.

The aim of these tutorials is **to provide a thorough introduction to all of MeiliSearch's core features**. It is **not** to provide exhaustive or universal instructions on how to use MeiliSearch's [SDKs](link here) or [API](link here).
