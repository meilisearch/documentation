# Quick start

This quick start will walk you through setting up Meilisearch, adding documents, performing your first search, using the search preview, adding a search bar, and securing your instance.

You will need:

- A [command line](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial#sec-running_a_terminal) for installation
- Some way to interact with Meilisearch afterwards (for example, [cURL](https://curl.se) or one of our [SDKs](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/sdks.md))

Let's get started!

## Setup and installation

We'll start with downloading and installing Meilisearch:

```bash
# Install Meilisearch
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh

# Launch Meilisearch
./meilisearch
```

You have the option to install Meilisearch locally or deploy it over a cloud service. Learn more about the other installation options in our [installation guide](/learn/getting_started/installation.md).

### Running Meilisearch

On successfully running Meilisearch, you should see the following response:

```

```

Congratulations! You're ready to move on to the next step!

::: note
If you started Meilisearch with a master key or using Meilisearch Cloud, you will need to add the [`-H Authorization: Bearer API_KEY` header](/reference/api/overview.md#authorization) to all your curl commands.
:::

## Add documents

For this quick start, we will be using a collection of movies as our dataset. To follow along, first click this link to download the file: <a id="downloadMovie" href="/movies.json" download="movies.json">movies.json</a>. Then, move the downloaded file into your working directory.

Open a new terminal window and run the following command:

<CodeSamples id="getting_started_add_documents_md" />

Meilisearch stores data in the form of discrete records, called [documents](/learn/core_concepts/documents.md). Documents are grouped into collections, called [indexes](/learn/core_concepts/indexes.md).

::: note
Meilisearch currently only accepts data in JSON, NDJSON, and CSV formats. You can read more about this in our [documents guide](/learn/core_concepts/documents.md#dataset-format).
:::

The previous command added documents from `movies.json` to a new index called `movies` and set `id` as the primary key. If it isn't set manually, Meilisearch [infers](/learn/core_concepts/primary_key.md#meilisearch-guesses-your-primary-key) it from your dataset.

Every index must have a [primary key](/learn/core_concepts/primary_key.md#primary-field), an attribute shared across all documents in that index. If you try adding documents to an index and even a single one is missing the primary key, none of the documents will be stored.

Meilisearch combines consecutive document requests into a single batch and processes them together. This process is called [auto-batching](/learn/core_concepts/documents.md#auto-batching), and it significantly speeds up indexing. After adding documents, you should receive a response like this:

```json
{
    "taskUid": 0,
    "indexUid": "movies",
    "status": "enqueued",
    "type": "documentAdditionOrUpdate",
    "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-11T09:25:53.000000Z"
}
```

Most database operations in Meilisearch are [asynchronous](/learn/advanced/asynchronous_operations.md). This means that rather than being processed instantly, **API requests are added to a queue and processed at a later time**.

Use the returned `taskUid` to [check the status](/reference/api/tasks.md) of your documents:

<CodeSamples id="getting_started_check_task_status" />

If the document addition is successful, the response should look like this:

```json
{
   "uid": 0,
   "indexUid": "movies",
   "status": "succeeded",
   "type": "documentAdditionOrUpdate",
   "canceledBy": null,
   "details":{
      "receivedDocuments": 19547,
      "indexedDocuments": 19547
   },
   "error": null,
   "duration": "PT0.030750S",
   "enqueuedAt": "2021-12-20T12:39:18.349288Z",
   "startedAt": "2021-12-20T12:39:18.352490Z",
   "finishedAt": "2021-12-20T12:39:18.380038Z"
}
```

If the `status` field has the value `enqueued` or `processing`, all you have to do is wait a short time and check again. Proceed to the next step once the task `status` has changed to `succeeded`.

## Search

Now that you have Meilisearch set up, you can start searching!

<CodeSamples id="getting_started_search_md" />

In the above code sample, the parameter `q` represents the search query. The documents you added in [the previous step](#add-documents) will be searched for text that matches `botman`.

**Meilisearch response**:

```json
{
  "hits": [
    {
      "id": 29751,
      "title": "Batman Unmasked: The Psychology of the Dark Knight",
      "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/jjHu128XLARc2k4cJrblAvZe0HE.jpg",
      "overview": "Delve into the world of Batman and the vigilante justice tha",
      "release_date": "2008-07-15"
    },
    {
      "id": 471474,
      "title": "Batman: Gotham by Gaslight",
      "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/7souLi5zqQCnpZVghaXv0Wowi0y.jpg",
      "overview": "ve Victorian Age Gotham City, Batman begins his war on crime",
      "release_date": "2018-01-12"
    },
    â€¦
  ],
  "estimatedTotalHits": 66,
  "query": "botman",
  "limit": 20,
  "offset": 0,
  "processingTimeMs": 12
}
```

By default, Meilisearch only returns the first 20 results for a search query. This can be changed using the [`limit` parameter](/reference/api/search.md#limit).

## Search preview

Meilisearch offers a browser-based search preview where you can search through a selected index. You can access it any time Meilisearch is running at `http://localhost:7700`.

![Meilisearch's search preview showing the movies index](/search_preview/default.png)

For security reasons, the search preview is only available in [development mode.](/learn/configuration/instance_options.md#environment)

If you have multiple indexes, you can switch between them using the indexes dropdown.

![Meilisearch's search preview indicating the indexes dropdown in the upper right corner](/search_preview/multiple_indexes.png)

## Customization

At this point, you can configure your entire Meilisearch instance, customize your indexes, and refine your results using:

- [Environment variables](/learn/configuration/instance_options.md#environment-variables) and [command-line options](/learn/configuration/instance_options.md#command-line-options-and-flags)

- A [configuration file](/learn/configuration/instance_options.md#configuration-file)

- [Index settings](/reference/api/settings.md)

- [Search parameters](/reference/api/search.md#search-parameters)

## Front-end integration

The only step missing now is adding a search bar to your project. The easiest way of achieving this is to use [instant-meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/instant-meilisearch): a plugin that establishes communication between your Meilisearch instance and [InstantSearch](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js). InstantSearch, an open-source project developed by Algolia, is the tool that renders all the components needed to start searching.

<CodeSamples id="getting_started_front_end_integration_md" />

### Let's try it!

1. Create an empty file and name it `index.html`
2. Open it in a text editor like Notepad, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code
3. Copy-paste one of the code samples aboveâ€”either vanilla JavaScript, Vue 2, or Reactâ€” and save the file
4. Open `index.html` in your browser by double-clicking it in your folder

You should now have a working front-end search interface ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

## Securing Meilisearch

The Meilisearch API is unprotected by default, making all routes publicly accessible. You can set a master key of at least 16 bytes to protect your instance from unauthorized use:

:::: tabs

::: tab CLI

```bash
./meilisearch --master-key="MASTER_KEY"
```

:::

::: tab Environment variable

UNIX:

```bash
export MEILI_MASTER_KEY="MASTER_KEY"
./meilisearch
```

Windows:

```bash
set MEILI_MASTER_KEY="MASTER_KEY"
./meilisearch
```

:::

::::

When you launch your Meilisearch instance with a master key, two things happen:

- Your Meilisearch instance is now protected. Aside from the [get health endpoint](/reference/api/health.md), all subsequent API requests must include a valid API key for [authorization](/reference/api/overview.md#authorization)
- Two [default API keys](/learn/security/master_api_keys.md#using-default-api-keys-for-authorization) are automatically generated

Here's how to use the master key you set to [get all keys](/reference/api/keys.md#get-all-keys):

<CodeSamples id="authorization_header_1" />

The master key should only be used for retrieving and managing API keys. For regular API calls, such as search, use an API key:

<CodeSamples id="getting_started_communicating_with_a_protected_instance" />

::: warning
Accessing the `/keys` route without setting a master key will return an [error](/reference/errors/error_codes.md#missing-master-key).
:::

To learn more about key management, refer to our [dedicated guide](/learn/security/master_api_keys.md).
