# What's Next?

MeiliSearch was built on a few core concepts. If you haven't already done so, we invite you to explore the following pages that will give you an essential insight into our search engine:

- [Documents](/learn/core_concepts/documents.md)
- [Indexes](/learn/core_concepts/indexes.md)
- [Relevancy](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy.md)

You can find the API references here:

- [API References](/reference/api/README.md)

And additional resources here:

- [SDKs](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/sdks.md)
- [FAQ](/resources/faq.md)
- [Advanced Topics](/learn/advanced)
- [How-To Guides](/create/how_to)
- [Postman Collection](/create/how_to/postman_collection.md): it can be tedious to re-write every route when wanting to try out an API. Try out MeiliSearch with our collection in Postman

More tutorials are currently in development and will be available soon.
