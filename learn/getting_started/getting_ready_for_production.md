# Chapter 3: Getting ready for production

This chapter will help you get ready to use Meilisearch in production by covering topics such as instance-wide options, data backup, and security.

## Instance options

Meilisearch allows you to configure your entire instance through **[environment variables](/learn/configuration/instance_options.md#environment-variables)** before launch or **[command-line options](/learn/configuration/instance_options.md#command-line-options-and-flags)** at launch.

Meilisearch has configuration options for many critical actions, such as:

- Changing the database path
- Starting Meilisearch in a development or production environment
- Setting a master key to protect API endpoints
- Disabling telemetry (enabled by default)

You can read about all of them in our [configuration guide](/learn/configuration/instance_options.md).

## Data backup

Meilisearch offers two options for backing up your data: `dumps` and `snapshots`.

Dumps export data in a raw unprocessed form and can be used to migrate your database between Meilisearch versions. A dump isn't an exact copy of your databaseâ€”it is closer to a blueprint that allows you to rebuild an identical database.

Snapshots, on the other hand, are an exact copy of your database. The documents in a snapshot are already "indexed" and ready to go, therefore they import faster than dumps. However, as a result, **snapshots are not compatible between different versions of Meilisearch.** You can schedule snapshots at regular intervals and use them for rolling back data.

You can read more about [dumps](/learn/advanced/dumps.md) and [snapshots](/learn/advanced/snapshots.md) in their dedicated guides.

## Protecting Meilisearch

Meilisearch allows you to restrict access to API endpoints. You can protect your Meilisearch instance by supplying it with an alphanumeric string representing your `master` key:

:::: tabs

::: tab CLI

```bash
./meilisearch --master-key="your_master_key"
```

:::

::: tab Environment variable

Linux/MacOS:

```bash
export MEILI_MASTER_KEY="your_master_key"
./meilisearch
```

Windows:

```bash
set MEILI_MASTER_KEY="your_master_key"
./meilisearch
```

:::

::::

Once this has been done, you must supply an API key with sufficient permissions whenever you make an API request. For example:

<CodeSamples id= getting_started_communicating_with_a_protected_instance />

You can customize all API keys, including altering their expiration dates and updating their permissions. Read more about Meilisearch and security in our [dedicated guide](/learn/security/master_api_keys.md).

## What's next
