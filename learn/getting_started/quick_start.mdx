# Quick start

This quick start walks you through installing Meilisearch, adding documents, and performing your first search.

To follow this tutorial you need:

- A [command line terminal](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial#sec-running_a_terminal)
- [cURL](https://curl.se) 
- Optional: one of our [SDKs](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/sdks) if you want to follow along in a specific programming language

## Setup and installation

First, you need to download and install Meilisearch. This command installs Meilisearch in your local machine:

```bash
# Install Meilisearch
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh
```

The rest of this guide assumes you are using Meilisearch locally, but you may also use Meilisearch over a cloud service, such as [Meilisearch Cloud](https://www.meilisearch.com/pricing). 

Learn more about the other installation options in our [installation guide](/learn/getting_started/installation).


### Running Meilisearch

Next, launch Meilisearch by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
# Launch Meilisearch
./meilisearch --master-key="aSampleMasterKey"
```

You should see something a bit like this in response:

```
888b     d888          d8b 888 d8b                                            888

Database path:       "./data.ms"
Server listening on: "localhost:7700"
```

You now have a Meilisearch instance running in your terminal window. Keep this window open for the rest of this tutorial.

This command uses the `--master-key` configuration option to secure Meilisearch. Setting a master key is optional but strongly recommended in development environments. Master keys are mandatory in production environments. To learn more about securing Meilisearch, refer to our [guide on API keys](/learn/security/master_api_keys).

## Add documents

For this quick start, we will use a collection of movies as our dataset.

To follow along, first click this link to download the file: <ButtonLink as="a" id="downloadMovie" href="/movies.json" download="movies.json">movies.json</ButtonLink>. Then, move the downloaded file into your working directory.

<Capsule intent="note">
Meilisearch accepts data in JSON, NDJSON, and CSV formats.
</Capsule>

Run the following command, opening a new terminal window if you are following this tutorial using `cURL`:

<CodeSamples id="getting_started_add_documents_md" />

Meilisearch stores data in the form of discrete records, called [documents](/learn/core_concepts/documents). Each document is composed of multiple fields, which are pairs of one attribute and one value:

```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "attribute": "value"
}
```

Documents are grouped into collections, called [indexes](/learn/core_concepts/indexes).

Every index must have a [primary key](/learn/core_concepts/primary_key#primary-field), an attribute shared across all documents in that index. If you try adding documents to an index and even a single one is missing the primary key, none of the documents will be stored.

The previous command added documents from `movies.json` to a new index called `movies`. It also set `id` as the primary key. If the primary key is not set manually, Meilisearch [infers](/learn/core_concepts/primary_key#meilisearch-guesses-your-primary-key) it from your dataset.

After adding documents, you should receive a response like this:

```json
{
    "taskUid": 0,
    "indexUid": "movies",
    "status": "enqueued",
    "type": "documentAdditionOrUpdate",
    "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-11T09:25:53.000000Z"
}
```

Most database operations in Meilisearch are [asynchronous](/learn/advanced/asynchronous_operations). Rather than being processed instantly, **API requests are added to a queue and processed at a later time**.

Use the returned `taskUid` to [check the status](/reference/api/tasks) of your documents:

<CodeSamples id="getting_started_check_task_status" />

If the document addition is successful, the response should look like this:

```json
{
   "uid": 0,
   "indexUid": "movies",
   "status": "succeeded",
   "type": "documentAdditionOrUpdate",
   "canceledBy": null,
   "details":{
      "receivedDocuments": 19547,
      "indexedDocuments": 19547
   },
   "error": null,
   "duration": "PT0.030750S",
   "enqueuedAt": "2021-12-20T12:39:18.349288Z",
   "startedAt": "2021-12-20T12:39:18.352490Z",
   "finishedAt": "2021-12-20T12:39:18.380038Z"
}
```

If `status` is `enqueued` or `processing`, all you have to do is wait a short time and check again. Proceed to the next step once the task `status` has changed to `succeeded`.

## Search

Now that you have Meilisearch set up, you can start searching!

<CodeSamples id="getting_started_search_md" />

In the above code sample, the parameter `q` represents the search query. This query instructs Meilisearch to search for `botman` in the documents you added in [the previous step](#add-documents):

```json
{
  "hits": [
    {
      "id": 29751,
      "title": "Batman Unmasked: The Psychology of the Dark Knight",
      "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/jjHu128XLARc2k4cJrblAvZe0HE.jpg",
      "overview": "Delve into the world of Batman and the vigilante justice tha",
      "release_date": "2008-07-15"
    },
    {
      "id": 471474,
      "title": "Batman: Gotham by Gaslight",
      "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/7souLi5zqQCnpZVghaXv0Wowi0y.jpg",
      "overview": "ve Victorian Age Gotham City, Batman begins his war on crime",
      "release_date": "2018-01-12"
    },
    …
  ],
  "estimatedTotalHits": 66,
  "query": "botman",
  "limit": 20,
  "offset": 0,
  "processingTimeMs": 12
}
```

By default, Meilisearch only returns the first 20 results for a search query. You can changed this using the [`limit` parameter](/reference/api/search#limit).

## What's next?

You now know all the basics: how to install Meilisearch, create an index, add documents, check the status of an asynchronous task, and search. 

Continue to the [Meilisearch 101](/learn/getting_started/filtering_and_sorting) for a guided overview of features such as filtering, sorting, fine-tuning search results and getting Meilisearch ready for production.

For a more advanced approach, you may want consult the [API references](/reference/api/overview), read up on core concepts such as [documents](/learn/core_concepts/documents) and [indexes](/learn/core_concepts/indexes), or take a look at some of our in-depth guides on topics like [search result pagination](/learn/advanced/pagination) and [running Meilisearch in a production environment](/learn/cookbooks/running_production).
