# Getting started with Meilisearch Cloud

This tutorial walks you through setting up Meilisearch Cloud, creating a project and an index, adding documents to it, and performing your first search with the default web interface.

You need a Meilisearch Cloud account to follow along. If you don't have one, register for a 14-day free trial account at [https://cloud.meilisearch.com/register](https://cloud.meilisearch.com/register).

## Creating a project

To use Meilisearch Cloud, you must first create a project. Projects act as containers for indexes, tasks, billing, and other information related to Meilisearch Cloud.

Click the "New project" button on the top menu. If you have a free trial account and this is your first project, the button will read "Start free trial" instead:

Name your project `meilisearch-quick-start` and select the region closest to you, then click on "Create project":

If you are not using a free trial account, you must also choose a billing plan based on the size of your dataset and number of searches per month:

Creating your project might take a few minutes. Once it is ready, you will see it in the project list. Click on the project name to go to the project overview page:

## Creating an index and adding documents

After creating your project, you must index the data you want to search. Meilisearch stores and processes data you add to it in indexes. A single project may contain multiple indexes.

First, click on the indexes tab in the project page menu:

This leads you to the index listing. Click on "Create an index":

Write `movies` in the name field and click on "Create Index":

The final step in creating an index is to add data to it. Choose "File upload":

Meilisearch Cloud will ask you for your dataset. To follow along with this tutorial, use this <ButtonLink as="a" id="downloadMovie" href="/movies.json" download="movies.json">list of movies</ButtonLink>. Download the file to your computer, drag and drop it into the specified area, then click on "Import documents":

![Another modal window with a large drag-and-drop area. It indicates a file named "movies.json" will be uploaded]({imageURL}/9-data-import.png)

Meilisearch Cloud will index your documents. This may take a moment. Click on "See index list" and wait. Once it is done, click on your index name to visit the index overview:

![A list of all indexes in this project. It shows a single index, `movies`, and indicates it contains over 30,000 documents]({imageURL}/10-index-list-filled.png)

## Searching

With all data uploaded and processed, the last step is to run a few test searches to confirm Meilisearch is running as expected.

Click on the project name to return to the project overview:

Meilisearch Cloud comes with a search preview interface. Click on the URL listed in your project overview to access it:

![The project overview page. A red arrow points at the URL linking to the search preview interface]({imageURL}/12-project-page-url.png)

Finally, try searching for a few movies, like "Solaris":

If you can see the results coming in as you type, congratulations: you now know all the basic steps to using Meilisearch Cloud.

## What's next

This tutorial taught you how to use Meilisearch Cloud's interface to create a project, add an index to it, and use the search preview interface. 

In most real-life settings, you will be creating your own search interface and retrieving results through Meilisearch's API. To learn how to add documents and search using the command-line or an SDK in your preferred language, check out the [Meilisearch quick start](/learn/getting_started/quick_start).
