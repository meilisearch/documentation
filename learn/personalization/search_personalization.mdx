## What is search personalization?

Search personalization lets you boost search results based on user profiles, making results more tailored to individual behavior.

## Why use search personalization?

Not all users search the same way. Personalizing search results allows you to adapt relevance to each user’s context — their preferences, behavior, or intent — instead of showing the same ranked results to everyone. This leads to faster discovery, improved satisfaction, and better business outcomes.

For example, in an e-commerce site, someone who often shops for sportswear might see sneakers and activewear ranked higher when searching for “shoes,” while another user interested in luxury fashion might see designer heels or leather boots first.

## How search personalization works?

Search personalization works by re-ranking search results at query time based on the user context you provide.
You send Meilisearch the user’s query along with a short description of their preferences, habits, or goals. Behind the scenes, this context is passed to a re-ranking model, which adjusts the order of results to better match that user’s profile.

In other words:

- You generate a compact, plain-text description of the user at search time. e.g "The user prefers genres like Documentary, Music, Drama. User engaged with content related to Rap or Hip-Hop."
- Meilisearch combines it with the query and retrieved documents for that query.
- The model then reorders results based on the user context so they feel more relevant to that user.

## How do I get access to search personalization?

We’re currently in a prototyping stage of search personalization and iterating quickly based on feedback. The feature is not yet publicly available and requires manual enablement.
