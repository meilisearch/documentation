# What is Meilisearch?

Meilisearch is a **RESTful search API**. It aims to be a **ready-to-go solution** for everyone who wants a **fast and relevant search experience** for their end-users ‚ö°Ô∏èüîé

Efficient search engines often require a significant investment of resources. They are only accessible to companies with the means necessary to develop a bespoke search solution that fits their needs.

Small-to-medium-sized businesses commonly resort to subpar search engines that incur invisible costs on their user experience and retention due to poor search fulfillment.

That's why we created Meilisearch: An open source solution accessible to everyone, designed to meet a vast majority of needs. Requiring very little configuration to be installed, yet highly customizable.

Our solution delivers an **instant search experience** including **typo handling**, **filters**, **custom rankings**, and many more [features](#features). Read on to learn more.

## Philosophy

Meilisearch is committed to providing **open source**, **easy to use**, **customizable** instant search that **focuses on the needs of end-users**.

## SDKs and integrations

Our team and community have worked hard to bring Meilisearch to almost all popular web development languages, frameworks, and deployment options‚Äîand new integrations are constantly in development. Check out [the full list of our integrations](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/sdks).

## Alternatives

Why should you use Meilisearch instead of any other existing solution? We try to answer this question in this [comparison to alternatives](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/comparison_to_alternatives). In short, Meilisearch most closely compares with Algolia. Meilisearch stands out by being open source (while commercial), and aims to be simpler to deploy and maintain than other competitors.

## Give it a try!

Instead of showing you examples, why not just invite you to test Meilisearch interactively in the **out-of-the-box search preview** we deliver?

There's no need to write a single line of front-end code. All you need to do is follow [this guide](/learn/getting_started/quick_start) to give the search engine a try!
