## Philosophy

Our goal is to provide a simple and intuitive experience for both developers and end-users. Ease of use was the primary focus of Meilisearch from its first release, and it continues to drive its development today.

Meilisearch's ease-of-use goes hand-in-hand with ultra relevant search results. Meilisearch **sorts results according to a set of [ranking rules](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy#ranking-rules)**. Our default ranking rules work for most use cases as we developed them by working directly with our users. You can also **configure the [search parameters](/reference/api/search)** to refine your search even further.

Meilisearch should **not be your main data store**. It is a search engine, not a database. Meilisearch should contain only the data you want your users to search through. If you must add data that is irrelevant to search, be sure to [make those fields non-searchable](/learn/configuration/displayed_searchable_attributes#searchable-fields) to improve relevancy and response time.

Meilisearch provides an intuitive search-as-you-type experience with response times under 50 milliseconds, no matter whether you are developing a site or an app. This helps end-users find what they are looking for quickly and efficiently. To make that happen, we are fully committed to the philosophy of [prefix search](/learn/engine/prefix).

## Give it a try!

Instead of showing you examples, why not just invite you to test Meilisearch interactively in the **out-of-the-box search preview** we deliver?

There's no need to write a single line of front-end code. All you need to do is follow [this guide](/learn/getting_started/quick_start) to give the search engine a try!
