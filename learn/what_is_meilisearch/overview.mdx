# What is Meilisearch?

Meilisearch is a **RESTful search API**. It aims to be a **ready-to-go solution** for everyone who wants a **fast and relevant search experience** for their end-users ⚡️🔎

Efficient search engines often require a significant investment of resources. They are only accessible to companies with the means necessary to develop a bespoke search solution that fits their needs.

Small-to-medium-sized businesses commonly resort to subpar search engines that incur invisible costs on their user experience and retention due to poor search fulfillment.

That's why we created Meilisearch: An open source solution accessible to everyone, designed to meet a vast majority of needs. Requiring very little configuration to be installed, yet highly customizable.

Our solution delivers an **instant search experience** including **typo handling**, **filters**, **custom rankings**, and many more [features](#features). Read on to learn more.

_Meilisearch helps the Rust community find crates on [crates.meilisearch.com](https://crates.meilisearch.com)._

## Features

- **Blazing fast**: Answers in less than 50 milliseconds
- **Search as you type**: Results are updated on each keystroke using [prefix-search](/learn/advanced/prefix#prefix-search)
- [Typo tolerance](/learn/configuration/typo_tolerance): Get relevant matches even when queries contain typos and misspellings
- [Comprehensive language support](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/language): Optimized support for **Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, and languages using the Latin alphabet**
- **Returns the whole document**: The entire document is returned upon search
- **Highly customizable search and indexing**: Customize search behavior to better meet your needs
  - [Custom ranking](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy): Customize the relevancy of the search engine and the ranking of the search results
  - [Filtering](/learn/fine_tuning_results/filtering) and [faceted search](/learn/fine_tuning_results/faceted_search): Enhance user search experience with custom filters and build a faceted search interface in a few lines of code
  - [Highlighting](/reference/api/search#highlight-tags): Highlighted search results in documents
  - [Stop words](/reference/api/settings#stop-words): Ignore common non-relevant words like `of` or `the`
  - [Synonyms](/reference/api/settings#synonyms): Configure synonyms to include more relevant content in your search results
- **RESTful API**: Integrate Meilisearch in your technical stack with our plugins and SDKs
- [Search preview](/learn/getting_started/search_preview): Allows you to test your search settings without implementing a front-end
- [API key management](/learn/security/master_api_keys): Protect your instance with API keys. Set expiration dates and control access to indexes and endpoints so that your data is always safe
- [Multi-tenancy and tenant tokens](/learn/security/tenant_tokens): Manage complex multi-user applications. Tenant tokens help you decide which documents each one of your users can search
- [Multi-search](/reference/api/multi_search): Perform multiple search queries on multiple indexes with a single HTTP request
- [Geosearch](/learn/fine_tuning_results/geosearch): Filter and sort results based on their geographic location
- [Index swapping](/learn/core_concepts/indexes#swapping-indexes): Deploy major database updates with zero search downtime

## Philosophy

Our goal is to provide a simple and intuitive experience for both developers and end-users. Ease of use was the primary focus of Meilisearch from its first release, and it continues to drive its development today.

Meilisearch's ease-of-use goes hand-in-hand with ultra relevant search results. Meilisearch **sorts results according to a set of [ranking rules](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy#ranking-rules)**. Our default ranking rules work for most use cases as we developed them by working directly with our users. You can also **configure the [search parameters](/reference/api/search)** to refine your search even further.

Meilisearch should **not be your main data store**. It is a search engine, not a database. Meilisearch should contain only the data you want your users to search through. If you must add data that is irrelevant to search, be sure to [make those fields non-searchable](/learn/configuration/displayed_searchable_attributes#searchable-fields) to improve relevancy and response time.

Meilisearch provides an intuitive search-as-you-type experience with response times under 50 milliseconds, no matter whether you are developing a site or an app. This helps end-users find what they are looking for quickly and efficiently. To make that happen, we are fully committed to the philosophy of [prefix search](/learn/advanced/prefix).

## Give it a try!

Instead of showing you examples, why not just invite you to test Meilisearch interactively in the **out-of-the-box search preview** we deliver?

There's no need to write a single line of front-end code. All you need to do is follow [this guide](/learn/getting_started/quick_start) to give the search engine a try!
