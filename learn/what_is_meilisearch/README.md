# What Is MeiliSearch?

MeiliSearch is a **RESTful search API**. It aims to be a **ready-to-go solution** for everyone who wants a **fast and relevant search experience** for their end-users ⚡️🔎

Efficient search engines often require a significant investment of resources. They are only accessible to companies with the means necessary to develop a bespoke search solution that fits their needs.

Small-to-medium-sized businesses commonly resort to subpar search engines that incur invisible costs on their user experience and retention due to poor search fulfillment.

That's why we created MeiliSearch: An open source solution accessible to everyone, designed to meet a vast majority of needs. Requiring very little configuration to be installed, yet highly customizable.

Our solution delivers an **instant search experience** including **typo handling**, **filters**, **custom rankings**, and many more [features](#features). Read on to learn more.

## Alternatives

Why should you use MeiliSearch instead of any other existing solution? We try to answer this question in this [comparison to alternatives](/resources/comparison_to_alternatives.md). In short, Meilisearch most closely compares with Algolia. Meilisearch stands out by being open source (while commercial) and aims to be simpler to deploy and maintain.

## Give it a try!

Instead of showing you examples, why not just invite you to test MeiliSearch interactively in the **out-of-the-box web interface** we deliver?

There's no need to write a single line of front-end code. All you need to do is follow [this guide](/guides/advanced_guides/web_interface.md) to give the search engine a try!
