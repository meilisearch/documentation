## Forum 📋

Our preferred method of communication is our [forum on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/discussions) (beta hype!). Asynchronous long-form discussion enables our increasingly distributed team and community to communicate across multiple timezones with minimal repetition.

Your project announcements, feature proposals, support queries and sweet, sweet praise all belongs in the forum.

## Chat 💬

Prefer the speed and fluidity of chat? Then join our [Slack community](https://slack.meilisearch.com/).

We think chat and forum discussions are [highly complementary](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/04/effectively-using-discourse-together-with-group-chat/), happily co-existing as two different modes of conversation. Try use the right tool for the job; but most importantly we just want to hear from you, regardless of medium!

## GitHub Issues 🔩

Bug reports should be added as issues in the corresponding repository, e.g. [meilisearch/MeiliSearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/issues), [meilisearch/documentation](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues) and so forth.

_Any suggestion or feedback is highly appreciated. Thank you for your support!_
