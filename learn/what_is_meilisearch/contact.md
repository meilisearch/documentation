# Contact Us

## Forum 📋

Our preferred method of communication is our [forum on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/discussions) (beta hype!). Asynchronous long-form discussion enables our increasingly distributed team and community to communicate across multiple timezones with minimal repetition.

Your project announcements, feature proposals, support queries and sweet, sweet praise all belongs in the forum.

## Chat 💬

Prefer the speed and fluidity of chat? Then join our [Slack community](https://slack.meilisearch.com/).

You can also talk to us via the bottom right chat widget available on every page of [our documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com/) and on [our landing page](https://www.meilisearch.com/).

We think chat and forum discussions are [highly complementary](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/04/effectively-using-discourse-together-with-group-chat/), happily co-existing as two different modes of conversation. Try use the right tool for the job; but most importantly we just want to hear from you, regardless of medium!

Bug reports should be added as issues in the corresponding repository, e.g. [meilisearch/MeiliSearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/issues), [meilisearch/documentation](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues) and so forth.

## Email 💌

Prefer a good old email? For a private conversation, you may message us at [bonjour@meilisearch.com](mailto:bonjour@meilisearch.com). English or French is welcome! 🇬🇧 🇫🇷 (+ 🇳🇴 🇧🇪)
