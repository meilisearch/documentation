# Fine-tuning search results

Meilisearch is designed to offer a great search experience out of the box, but sometimes you need to customize it to better fit your needs. You can alter the search behavior for each index using the `settings` object.

For this chapter, we will be using a collection of movies as our dataset.

To follow along, first click this link to download the file: <ButtonLink as="a" id="downloadMovie" href="/movies.json" download="movies.json">movies.json</ButtonLink>. Then, move it into your working directory and run the following command:

<CodeSamples id="getting_started_add_documents_md" />

## Ranking rules

Meilisearch sorts search responses based on an array of rules called `rankingRules`, which is part of the `settings` object.

The order of the `rankingRules` array matters: the first rule has the most impact and the last rule has the least. This is the default order:

```
"rankingRules": [
  "words",
  "typo",
  "proximity",
  "attribute",
  "sort",
  "exactness"
]
```

You can read more about each ranking rule and what it does in our [dedicated guide](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy#built-in-rules).

In this example, we change the order of the ranking rules for the `movies` index by moving `exactness` to the top:

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_update_ranking_rules" />

You can read more about ranking rules in our [dedicated guide](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy).

## Displayed attributes

By default, all attributes are displayed in search results but the `displayedAttributes` array in the `settings` object allows you to change that.

If you only want to display the `title`, `poster`, and `overview` for the `movies` index:

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_update_displayed_attributes" />

You can read more about displayed attributes in our [dedicated guide](/learn/configuration/displayed_searchable_attributes#displayed-fields).

## Distinct attribute

If you have groups of almost identical documents, you may wish to only return one of them per search. `distinctAttribute` is a tool in the `settings` object that allows you to do just that.

When you set one of your attributes as the `distinctAttribute`, Meilisearch will not return more than one document with the same value associated to that attribute.

Suppose you have an e-commerce dataset with an index on jackets. There are several identical items with minor variations in color.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "description": "Leather jacket",
    "brand": "Lee jeans",
    "color": "brown",
    "product_id": "123456"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "description": "Leather jacket",
    "brand": "Lee jeans",
    "color": "black",
    "product_id": "123456"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "description": "Leather jacket",
    "brand": "Lee jeans",
    "color": "blue",
    "product_id": "123456"
  }
]
```

If you searched for `lee leather jacket` with the default settings, you would get all three documents. But if you set `product_id` as the `distinctAttribute`, Meilisearch will only return one of those jackets.

You can read more about the distinct attribute in our [dedicated guide](/learn/configuration/distinct).

## Searchable attributes

[Documents](/learn/core_concepts/documents) in Meilisearch are composed of multiple fields. By default, Meilisearch looks for matches in every field, but the `searchableAttributes` array in the `settings` object allows you to change that.

For example, if you search the `movies` index for `2012`, Meilisearch searches for `2012` in every field: the `title`, `overview`, `release_year`, and so on. If you just want to search in the `title` field:

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_update_searchable_attributes" />

Meilisearch will now only consider `title` during search, and you will see fewer results.

<Capsule intent="note">

Meilisearch will still highlight matches in other fields, but they won’t be used to compute results.

</Capsule>

### The order of `searchableAttributes`

The order of the `searchableAttributes` array corresponds to the order of importance of the attributes.

```json
  [
    "overview",
    "title",
  ]
```

With the above order, matching words found in the `overview` field will have a higher impact on relevancy than the same words found in `title`. You can read more about this in our [relevancy guide](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy#attribute-ranking-order).

## Stop words

Meilisearch allows you to ignore certain words in your search queries by adding them to the `stopWords` array. A good example is the word `the` in English.

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_update_stop_words" />

If you search for `the cat` after running the above command, Meilisearch will consider your search query to be `cat`, improving the speed and relevancy of your search.

You can read more about stop words in the [API reference](/reference/api/settings#stop-words).

## Synonyms

The `synonyms` array lets you associate certain words in your dataset, telling Meilisearch that they are equivalent and interchangeable.

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_synonyms" />

This will set `winnie` and `piglet` as synonyms. Searching for either won't always return the same results due to factors like typos and splitting the query.

You can read more about it in our [dedicated guide](/learn/configuration/synonyms).

## Typo tolerance

Meilisearch is typo tolerant by default. It will help you find relevant search results even if you make spelling mistakes or typos, for example, searching for `swaj` instead of `swan`.

The `typoTolerance` object allows you to:

- Enable or disable the typo tolerance feature
- Configure the minimum word size for typos
- Disable typos on specific words
- Disable typos on specific attributes

Meilisearch accepts one typo for query terms containing `5` or more characters by default. If you search the movies index for `swaj`, you will not get any results.

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_typo_tolerance" />

The above code sample sets the minimum word size for one typo to `4` characters. If you search for `swaj` now, you should get some results.

You can read more about typo tolerance in our [dedicated guide](/learn/configuration/typo_tolerance).

## Faceting

Meilisearch allows you to create faceted search interfaces, refining search results based on broad categories called facets. Like filters, you need to add the attributes you want to use as facets to `filterableAttributes`.

When creating a faceted search interface, it is helpful to display how results are distributed between the different categories. For example, a user might want to know how many of their results have a `genre` of `comedy` and how many have a `genre` of `horror`. Meilisearch supports this with [the `facets` search parameter](/reference/api/search#facets).

Using the faceting settings, you can configure:

- The maximum number of facet values returned for each facet
- Sort facet values by value count or alphanumeric order

Suppose your results contain the following values for the `genres` facet: `Action`, `Adventure`, `Science Fiction`, and `Comedy`. After running the below code sample, you would only see how results are distributed between the `Action` and `Adventure` genres. `Action` and `Adventure` will be sorted by descending value count.

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_faceting" />

You can read more about faceting in our [dedicated guide](/learn/fine_tuning_results/faceted_search).

## Pagination

By default, Meilisearch returns 1000 results per search. This limit protects your database from malicious scraping.

The code sample below sets this limit to 500:

<CodeSamples id= "getting_started_pagination" />

Now, users won't be able to access search results beyond 500.

You can read more about pagination in our [dedicated guide](/learn/front_end/pagination).

The next chapter tackles more advanced topics, including security and data backup.
