# Bind analytics events to a user

By default, Meilisearch associates analytics events with the most recent search of the user who triggered them. This guide shows you how to manually bind analytics events to search queries using the `X-MS-USER-ID` HTTP header.

## Requirements

- A Meilisearch Cloud project with analytics and monitoring enabled
- A working pipeline for submitting analytics events

## Add `X-MS-USER-ID` to your search query

Include the `X-MS-USER-ID` header in your search requests:

<CodeSamples id="analytics_event_bind_search_1" />

Replace `MEILISEARCH_USER_ID` with any value that uniquely identifies that user. This may be an authenticated user's ID when running searches from your own back end, or a user's IP address.

## Add `X-MS-USER-ID` to the analytics event

Next, submit your analytics event to the analytics endpoint. Send the same header and value in your API call:

<CodeSamples id="analytics_event_bind_event_1" />

## Conclusion

In this guide you have seen how to bind analytics events to specific users by specifying the same HTTP header for both the search request and the analytics event.
