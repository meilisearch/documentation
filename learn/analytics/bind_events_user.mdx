This guide shows you how to manually link analytics events to specific users.

## Requirements

- A Meilisearch Cloud project
- A method for identifying users
- A pipeline for submitting analytics events

## Assign user IDs to search requests

You can assign user IDs to search requests by including an `X-MS-USER-ID` header with your query:

<CodeSamplesAnalyticsEventBindSearch1 />

Replace `SEARCH_USER_ID` with any value that uniquely identifies that user. This may be an authenticated user's ID when running searches from your own back end, or a hash of the user's IP address.

<Note>
Assigning user IDs to search requests is optional. If a Meilisearch Cloud search request does not have an ID, Meilisearch will automatically generate one.
</Note>

## Assign user IDs to analytics events

You can assign a user ID to analytics `/events` in two ways: HTTP headers or including it in the event payload.

If using HTTP headers, include an `X-MS-USER-ID` header with your query:

<CodeSamplesAnalyticsEventBindEvent1 />

If you prefer to the event in your payload, include a `userId` field with your request:

<CodeSamplesAnalyticsEventBindEvent2 />

Replace `SEARCH_USER_ID` with any value that uniquely identifies that user. This may be an authenticated user's ID when running searches from your own back end, or a hash of the user's IP address.

<Warning>
It is mandatory to specify a user ID when sending analytics events.
</Warning>

## Conclusion

In this guide you have seen how to bind analytics events to specific users by specifying an HTTP header for the search request, and either an HTTP header or a `userId` field for the analytics event.
