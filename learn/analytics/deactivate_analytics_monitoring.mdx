# Deactivate search analytics and monitoring

This guide shows you how to deactivate Meilisearch Cloud's search analytics and monitoring.

## Disable analytics and monitoring in the project overview

Log into your Meilisearch Cloud account and navigate to your project's overview. Find the "Analytics and monitoring" section and press the "Disable analytics and monitoring" button:

## Update URLs in your application

Disabling analytics and monitoring changes your API URL. Update your application so all API requests point to the correct URL:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST 'https://PROJECT_URL/indexes/products/search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{ "q": "green socks" }'
```

**The previous API URL will remain functional**, but Meilisearch recommends not using it after disabling analytics in your project. If you created any custom API keys using the previous URL, you will need to replace them.

## Update `conversion` and `click` events

If you were tracking `conversion` and `click` events, update your application to stop sending them to Meilisearch Cloud.
