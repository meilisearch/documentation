# Analytics events reference

When using Meilisearch Cloud analytics, certain data points require you to send data to the `/events` route.

## The `/events` endpoint

The `/events` endpoint is only available for Meilisearch Cloud projects with analytics and monitoring activated.

### Send an event

<RouteHighlighter method="POST" route="https://edge.meilisearch.com/events"/>

Send an analytics event to Meilisearch Cloud. Accepts `click` and `conversion` events.

<Capsule intent="tip" title="Binding analytics events to a search">
Meilisearch automatically associates analytics events with the most recent search of the user who triggered them. To manually bind an analytics event to a specific search, include the same `X-MS-USER-ID` header in your search and event requests.
</Capsule>

#### Example

<CodeSamples id="analytics_event_send_1" />

##### Response: `201 Created`

### The `click` event object

The `click` event must deliver an object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "eventType": "click",
  "eventName": "Search Result Clicked",
  "indexUid": "products",
  "objectId": "0",
  "position": 0
}
```

- `eventType`: a string indicating this is a `click` event
- `eventName`: a string describing the event
- `indexUid`: a string indicating the clicked document's index
- `objectId`: a string indicating the clicked document's primary key
- `position`: an integer indicating the clicked document's position in the list of search results

### The `conversion` event object

The `conversion` event must deliver an object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "eventType": "conversion",
  "eventName": "Product Added To Cart",
  "indexUid": "products",
  "objectID": "0",
  "position": 0
}
```

- `eventType`: indicates this is a `conversion` event
- `eventName`: a string describing the event
- `indexUid`: the document's index
- `objectID`: the document's primary key
- `position`: the document's position in the list of search results
