## Requirements

You must have a [Meilisearch Cloud](https://meilisearch.com/cloud) account to access search analytics.

## Configure click-through rate and average click position

To track click-through rate and average click position, Meilisearch Cloud needs to know when users click on search results.

Every time a user clicks on a search result, your application must send a `click` event to the `POST` endpoint of Meilisearch Cloud's `/events` route:

<CodeSamplesAnalyticsEventClick1 />

You must explicitly submit a `userId` associated with the event. This can be any arbitrary string you use to identify the user, such as their profile ID in your application or their hashed IP address. You may submit user IDs directly on the event payload, or setting a `X-MS-USER-ID` request header.

Specifying a `queryUid` is optional but recommended as it ensures Meilisearch correctly associates the search query with the event. You can find the query UID in the [`metadata` field present in Meilisearch Cloud's search query responses](/reference/api/overview#search-metadata).

For more information, consult the [analytics events endpoint reference](/learn/analytics/events_endpoint).

## Configure conversion rate

To track conversion rate, first identify what should count as a conversion for your application. For example, in a web shop a conversion might be a user finalizing the checkout process.

Once you have established what is a conversion in your application, configure it to send a `conversion` event to the `POST` endpoint of Meilisearch Cloud analytics route:

<CodeSamplesAnalyticsEventConversion1 />

You must explicitly submit a `userId` associated with the event. This can be any arbitrary string you can use to identify the user, such as their profile ID in your application or their hashed IP address. You may submit user IDs directly on the event payload, or setting a `X-MS-USER-ID` request header.

Specifying a `queryUid` is optional but recommended as it ensures Meilisearch correctly associates the search query with the event. You can find the query UID in the `metadata` field present in Meilisearch Cloud's search query response.

<Note>
It is not possible to associate multiple `conversion` events with the same query.
