# Analytics events endpoint

This reference describes `/events`, the endpoint you should use to submit analytics events to Meilisearch Cloud. It also describes the accepted event objects and the data you must include in them.

## The `/events` endpoint

The `/events` endpoint is only available for Meilisearch Cloud projects with analytics and monitoring activated.

### Send an event

<RouteHighlighter method="POST" route="https://edge.meilisearch.com/events"/>

Send an analytics event to Meilisearch Cloud. Accepts [`click`](#the-click-event-object) and [`conversion`](#the-conversion-event-object) events.

<Capsule intent="tip" title="Binding analytics events to a user">
By default, Meilisearch associates analytics events with the most recent search of the user who triggered them. Include the same `X-MS-USER-ID` header in your search and event requests to manually [bind analytics events to a user](/learn/analytics/bind_events_user).
</Capsule>

#### Example
