# Replication parameters

The `--experimental-replication-parameters` instance option helps running Meilisearch in cluster environments. It does this by modifying task handling in three ways:

- Task auto-deletion is disabled
- Allows you to manually set task uids by adding a custom `TaskId` header to your API requests
- Allows you to dry register tasks
