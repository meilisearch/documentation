# Experimental features overview

Experimental features are features added in a minor version (`v0.x.y`) that may not have been tested to the same standards as our other features, and which may be reworked or removed in a future version. Experimental features can come with an increased risk of bugs or unforseen behavior, but offer powerful, game-changing functionality in exchange.

## Why mark a feature as experimental?

Since `v0.1`, most of the features added to Meilisearch have been fairly cut-and-dry implementations of features that already exist in similar search engines, such as Algolia or Elasticsearch, albeit with some modifications to add _that special Meilisearch touch_ ✨

However, as Meilisearch becomes a more complex piece of software, it becomes necessary for the development team to test out features that aren't based on any precedent. Finding the best possible implementation for our users' needs necessitates some trial and error—along with a massive amount of user feedback—which is why we designate these features experimental.

**In other words, a feature labeled experimental can and will change in the future.**

As mentioned, evolving an experimental feature to a finished state requires feedback from our community. If you find some use for an experimental feature, please tell us about your experience using the associated GitHub discussion.
