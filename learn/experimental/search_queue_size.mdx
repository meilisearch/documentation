# Search queue size

Meilisearch queues up to 1000 search requests at any given moment. This limit exists to prevent Meilisearch from consuming an unbounded amount of RAM. Use `--experimental-search-queue-size` to configure this limit.

<Capsule intent="warning">
This is an experimental feature. Experimental features are unstable: their API might significantly change and become incompatible between releases. Meilisearch does not recommend using experimental features in a production environment.

Meilisearch makes experimental features available expecting they will become stable in a future release. However, it is not possible to guarantee when and if this will happen.
