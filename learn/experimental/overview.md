# Experimental features

## What is an experimental feature?

Meilisearch maintains a high standard for new features. The process of adding a new feature to our search engine typically begins with a specification, centers around copious unit testing, and ends with the feature's release, barring some minor iteration in subsequent versions.

This is not necessarily the case for experimental features. **Experimental features are features that may not have been tested to our usual standards, and which may be reworked or removed entirely in future versions.** They come with an increased risk of bugs and unforseen behavior, but some users may find the extra functionality to be worth the risk.

## Giving feedback

**Each experimental feature added to Meilisearch has an associated discussion on our [core GitHub repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/discussions/categories/general?discussions_q=category%3AGeneral+experimental).**

The feedback from these discussions helps us evaluate the success or failure of experimental features, as well as potentially evolve them into a stable, non-experimental state.

Whether you want to share a bug report, an opinion, or a story about your experience with the feature, we are grateful for your contribution!
