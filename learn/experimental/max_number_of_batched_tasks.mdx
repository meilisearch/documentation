# Maximum batched tasks

Use this experimental feature to limit the number of tasks Meilisearch performs in a single batch. May improve stability in systems handling a large queue of resource-intensive tasks.

To enable it, relaunch Meilisearch with the `--experimental-max-number-of-batched-tasks` command-line option, specifying the maximum amount of tasks you want to process in a single batch:

```sh
./meilisearch --experimental-max-number-of-batched-tasks 100
```

You may also activate this option with environment variables or in the configuration file by using `MEILI_EXPERIMENTAL_MAX_NUMBER_OF_BATCHED_TASKS`.

<Capsule intent="warning">
This is an experimental feature. Experimental features are unstable: their API might significantly change and become incompatible between releases. Meilisearch does not recommend using experimental features in a production environment.

Meilisearch makes experimental features available expecting they will become stable in a future release. However, it is not possible to guarantee when and if this will happen.
