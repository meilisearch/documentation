# Log customization

Customize Meilisearch logs with two experimental features: `--experimental-logs-mode` and `--experimental-enable-logs-route`.

## Customize log output

Use `--experimental-logs-mode` to customize log output:

```sh
./meilisearch --experimental-logs-mode json
```

`--experimental-logs-mode` accepts either `human` or `json`. `human` is the default value.

For more information, [consult this feature's GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/discussions/723).

## Log routes

Activate the `/logs` routes during runtime using the `/experimental-features` route:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "logsRoute": true
  }'
```

Use `/logs/stderr` to customize logging levels for the default logging system:

```sh
curl \
	-X POST http://localhost:7700/logs/stderr \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	--data-binary '{
      "target": "milli=trace,index_scheduler=info,actix_web=off"
  }'
```

Use the `POST` endpoint of `/logs/stream` for focused debugging sessions:

```sh
curl \
	-X POST http://localhost:7700/logs/stream \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	--data-binary '{
    "mode": "human",
    "target": "index_scheduler=trace"
  }'
```

Configure the stream using the same parameters as regular logging: `mode` and `target`. The stream will continue to run indefinitely until you interrupt it.

<Capsule intent="warning" title="HTTP client compatibility">
Certain HTTP clients such as `httpie` and `xh`, will only display data after you have interrupted the stream with the `DELETE` endpoint.
</Capsule>

Use the `DELETE` endpoint of `/logs/stream` to interrupt a stream:

```sh
curl \
  -X DELETE http://localhost:7700/logs/stream
```

<Capsule intent="warning">
These features are experimental. Experimental features are unstable: their API might significantly change and become incompatible between releases. Meilisearch does not recommend using experimental features in a production environment.

Meilisearch makes experimental features available expecting they will become stable in a future release. However, it is not possible to guarantee when and if this will happen.
