# Vector search

[Vector search](https://meilisearch.com/solutions/vector-search) is an experimental technology that uses Large Language Models to retrieve search results based on the meaning and context of a query.

This feature can improve search relevancy for queries that do not to match keywords in your dataset, allow your users to search images and other non-textual media, suggest related products in webshops, and create conversational search interfaces.

Vector search is available to all users. [Meilisearch Cloud](https://www.meilisearch.com/cloud?utm_campaign=oss&utm_source=docs&utm_medium=vector-search) is the recommended way of using vector search.

## Using vector search

### Activate vector search

Use the `/experimental` route to activate vector search during runtime:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "vectorSearch": true
  }'
```

### Generate vector embeddings using a third-party tool

To use vector search, you must generate embeddings with a third-party tool such as OpenAI, HuggingFace, Cohere.AI, and Anthropic API.

<Capsule intent="note" title="What is an embedding?">
Vector search relies on embeddings to function. Vector embeddings are a way of representing data that identify similarities in meaning and context.

### Add embeddings to Meilisearch

Use the `/documents` endpoint to upload vectorized documents. Store vector data in your documents' `_vector` field:

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
'localhost:7700/indexes/myvectors/documents' \
--data-binary '[
    { "id": 0, "_vectors": [0, 0.8, -0.2], "text": "Hello World" },
    { "id": 1, "_vectors": [1, -0.2, 0], "text": "Hello Doggy" },
    { "id": 2, "_vectors": [[0.5, 3, 1], [-0.2, 4, 6]], "text": "Hello People" }
]'
```

### Use `vector` to query Meilisearch

Use the `vector` search parameter to perform vector searches:

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  'localhost:7700/indexes/myvectors/search' \
  --data-binary '{ "vector": [0, 1, 2] }'
```

Meilisearch does not calculate search vectors. Generate these using a third-party tool.
