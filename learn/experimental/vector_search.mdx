# Vector search

[Vector search](https://meilisearch.com/solutions/vector-search) is an experimental technology that uses Large Language Models to retrieve search results based on the meaning and context of a query.

This feature can improve search relevancy for queries that do not to match keywords in your dataset, allow your users to search images and other non-textual media, suggest related products in webshops, and create conversational search interfaces.

Vector search is available to all users. [Meilisearch Cloud](https://www.meilisearch.com/cloud?utm_campaign=oss&utm_source=docs&utm_medium=vector-search) is the recommended way of using vector search.

## Using vector search

### Activate vector search

If using Meilisearch Cloud, navigate to your project overview and find "Experimental features", then check the "vector store" box.

![A section of the project overview interface titled "Experimental features". There are two options: "Score details" and "Vector store". "Vector store" is turned on.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/images/vector-search/01-cloud-vector-store.png)

Alternatively, use [the `/experimental` route](/reference/api/experimental_features) to activate vector search during runtime:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "vectorSearch": true
  }'
```

### Generate vector embeddings using a third-party tool

To use vector search, you must generate embeddings with a third-party tool such as [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), [Cohere.AI](https://cohere.com/), and [Anthropic API](https://www.anthropic.com/).

Vector search relies on embeddings. Vector embeddings are a way of representing data that identify similarities in meaning and context.

### Add embeddings to Meilisearch

Use [the `/documents` endpoint](/reference/api/documents) to upload vectorized documents. Store vector data in your documents' `_vector` field:

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
'localhost:7700/indexes/products/documents' \
--data-binary '[
    { "id": 0, "_vectors": [0, 0.8, -0.2], "name": "frying pan" },
    { "id": 1, "_vectors": [1, -0.2, 0], "text": "baking dish" },
    { "id": 2, "_vectors": [[0.5, 3, 1], [-0.2, 4, 6]], "text": "spork" }
]'
```

### Use `vector` to query Meilisearch

Use the `vector` search parameter to perform vector searches:

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  'localhost:7700/indexes/products/search' \
  --data-binary '{ "vector": [0, 1, 2] }'
```

`vector` must be an array of numbers indicating the search vector. Meilisearch does not calculate search vectors, so you must generate them using a third-party tool.
