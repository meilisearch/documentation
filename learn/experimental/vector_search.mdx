# Vector search

[Vector search](https://meilisearch.com/solutions/vector-search?utm_campaign=vector-search&utm_source=docs) is an experimental technology that uses Large Language Models to retrieve search results based on the meaning and context of a query.

This feature can improve search relevancy for queries that do not to match keywords in your dataset, allow your users to search images and other non-textual media, suggest related products in webshops, and create conversational search interfaces.

Vector search is available to all users. [Meilisearch Cloud](https://www.meilisearch.com/cloud?utm_campaign=vector-search&utm_source=docs) is the recommended way of using vector search.

## Using vector search

### Activate vector search

If using Meilisearch Cloud, navigate to your project overview and find "Experimental features", then check the "vector store" box.

![A section of the project overview interface titled "Experimental features". There are two options: "Score details" and "Vector store". "Vector store" is turned on.](/assets/images/vector-search/01-cloud-vector-store.png)

Alternatively, use [the `/experimental-features` route](/reference/api/experimental_features) to activate vector search during runtime:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "vectorStore": true
  }'
```

<Capsule intent="note" title="Meilisearch Cloud AI-powered search waitlist">
To ensure proper scaling of Meilisearch Cloud's latest AI-powered search offering, you must enter the waitlist before activating vector search. You will not be able to activate vector search in the Cloud interface or via the `/experimental-features` route until your sign up has been approved.
</Capsule>

### Generate vector embeddings

To use vector search, first configure the `embedders` index setting. You may configure multiple embedders for an index.

Embedders generate vector data from your documents. Meilisearch natively supports the following embedders:

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- any embedder with a REST interface

It is also possible to [supply custom embeddings](#generate-custom-embeddings-manually). In this case, you must generate the embeddings manually and include them as a field in your documents.

#### Generate auto-embeddings

<Tabs.Container labels={["OpenAI", "Hugging Face", "Ollama", "REST"]}>
<Tabs.Content label="OpenAI">
Use the `embedders` index setting of the [update `/settings` endpoint](/reference/api/settings) to configure one or more embedders for an index:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "embedders": {
      "default": {
        "source":  "openAi",
        "apiKey": "anOpenAiApiKey",
        "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
        "documentTemplate": "A movie titled {{doc.title}} whose description starts with {{doc.overview|truncatewords: 20}}",
        "dimensions": 1536
      }
    }
  }'
```

It is mandatory to pass an OpenAI API key through the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or the `apiKey` field when using an OpenAI embedder. [Generate an API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) from your OpenAI account. Use [tier 2 keys](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers?context=tier-two) or above for optimal performance.

`model` is a mandatory field indicating a compatible OpenAI model. Meilisearch supports the following [OpenAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/embeddings): `openai-text-embedding-ada-002`, `text-embedding-3-small`, and `text-embedding-3-large`.

`documentTemplate` is an optional field. Use it to customize the data you send to the embedder. It is highly recommended you configure a custom template for your documents.

`dimensions` is an optional field. It must be bigger than zero and lower or equal to the chosen model's dimensions. This option is not compatible with `text-embedding-ada-002`. Fewer dimensions may improve performance, but lead to lower search result accuracy.

<Tabs.Content label="Hugging Face">
The Hugging Face embedder computes embeddings locally. This is a resource-intensive operation and might affect indexing performance. You may be able to significantly improve performance by [compiling a CUDA-compatible Meilisearch binary](/guides/ai/computing_hugging_face_embeddings_gpu).

Use the `embedders` index setting of the [update `/settings` endpoint](/reference/api/settings) to configure one or more embedders for an index:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "embedders": {
      "default": {
        "source": "huggingFace",
        "model": "BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5",
        "documentTemplate": "A movie titled {{doc.title}} whose description starts with {{doc.overview|truncatewords: 20}}"
      }
    }
  }'
```

`documentTemplate` is an optional field you can use to customize the data you send to the embedder. It is highly recommended you configure a custom template for your documents.

`model` is mandatory and must indicate a BERT embedding model.
</Tabs.Content>

<Tabs.Content label="Ollama">
Use the `embedders` index setting of the [update `/settings` endpoint](/reference/api/settings) to configure one or more embedders for an index:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "embedders": {
      "default": {
        "source": "ollama",
        "url": "http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings",
        "apiKey": "OLLAMA_API_KEY",
        "model": "MODEL_NAME",
        "documentTemplate": "A document titled {{doc.title}} whose description starts with {{doc.overview|truncatewords: 20}}"
      }
    }
  }'
```

`url` indicates the embedder address. If not specified, Meilisearch will try to fetch the `MEILI_OLLAMA_URL` environment variable.

`apiKey` is an optional field indicating your Ollama API key, if you have configured it.

`model` is a mandatory field indicating a [compatible model](https://ollama.com/library).

`documentTemplate` is an optional field. Use it to customize the data you send to the embedder. It is highly recommended you configure a custom template for your documents.
</Tabs.Content>

<Tabs.Content label="REST">
The generic REST source is compatible with any embedder with a REST API without a dedicated Meilisearch `source`.

Use the `embedders` index setting of the [update `/settings` endpoint](/reference/api/settings) to configure one or more embedders for an index:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "embedders": {
      "default": {
        "source": "rest",
        "url": "http://localhost:12345/api/v1/embed",
        "apiKey": "SOURCE_API_KEY",
        "dimensions": 512,
        "documentTemplate": "A document titled {{doc.title}} whose description starts with {{doc.overview|truncatewords: 20}}",
        "inputField": ["data", "text"],
        "inputType": "text",
        "query": {
          "model": "MODEL_NAME",
          "dimensions": 512
        },
        "pathToEmbeddings": ["data"],
        "embeddingObject": ["embedding"]
      }
    }
  }'
```

`url` indicates the embedder address. If not specified, Meilisearch will try to fetch the `MEILI_OLLAMA_URL` environment variable.

`apiKey` is an optional field indicating your source's API key, if you have configured it.

`model` is a mandatory field indicating a compatible model.

`documentTemplate` is an optional field. Use it to customize the data you send to the embedder. It is highly recommended you configure a custom template for your documents.
</Tabs.Content>
</Tabs.Container>

<Capsule intent="tip" title="`documentTemplate` usage">
`documentTemplate` must be a [Liquid template](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). Use `{{ doc.attribute }}` to access the `attribute` field value of your documents. Meilisearch also exposes a `{{ fields }}` array containing one object per document field, which you may access with `{{ field.name }}` and `{{ field.value }}`.

Any field you refer to in this way must exist in all documents or an error will be raised at indexing time.

For best results, use short strings indicating the type of document in that index, only include highly relevant document fields, and truncate long fields.
</Capsule>

#### Generate custom embeddings manually

You may also provide custom embeddings. In this case, you must manually update your embeddings when adding, updating, and removing documents to your index.

Configure the `embedder` index setting:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "embedders": {
      "image2text": {
        "source":  "userProvided",
        "dimensions": 3
      }
    }
  }'
```

Then, use [the `/documents` endpoint](/reference/api/documents) to upload vectorized documents. Store vector data in your documents' `_vectors` field:

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
'localhost:7700/indexes/products/documents' \
--data-binary '[
    { "id": 0, "_vectors": {"image2text": [0, 0.8, -0.2]}, "text": "frying pan" },
    { "id": 1, "_vectors": {"image2text": [1, -0.2, 0]}, "text": "baking dish" }
]'
```

### Distribution shift

For mathematical reasons, the `_rankingScore` of semantic search results tend to be closely grouped around an average value that depends on the embedder and model used. This may result in relevant semantic hits being underrepresented and irrelevant semantic hits being overrepresented compared with keyword search hits.

Use `distribution` when configuring an embedder to correct the returned `_rankingScore`s of the semantic hits with an affine transformation:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "embedders": {
      "default": {
        "source":  "huggingFace",
        "model": "MODEL_NAME",
        "distribution": {
          "mean": 0.7,
          "sigma": 0.3
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

Configuring `distribution` requires a certain amount of trial and error, in which you must perform semantic searches and monitor the results. Based on their `rankingScore`s and relevancy, add the observed `mean` and `sigma` values for that index.

`distribution` is an optional field compatible with all embedder sources. It must be an object with two fields:

- `mean`: a number between `0` and `1` indicating the semantic score of "somewhat relevant" hits before using the `distribution` setting
- `sigma`: a number between `0` and `1` indicating the average absolute difference in `_rankingScore`s between "very relevant" hits and "somewhat relevant" hits, and "somewhat relevant" hits and "irrelevant hits".

Changing `distribution` does not trigger a reindexing operation.

### Vector search with auto-embeddings

Perform searches with `q` and `hybrid` to retrieve search results using both keyword and semantic search:

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  'localhost:7700/indexes/products/search' \
  --data-binary '{
    "q": "kitchen utensils",
    "hybrid": {
      "semanticRatio": 0.9,
      "embedder": "default"
    }
  }'
```

`hybrid` is an object and accepts two fields:
- `semanticRatio`: number between `0` and `1`. `0` indicates full keyword search, `1` indicates full semantic search. Defaults to `0.5`
- `embedder`: string, indicating one of the embedders configured for the queried index. Defaults to `"default"`

`hybrid` can be used together with [other search parameters](/reference/api/search), including [`filter`](/reference/api/search#filter) and [`sort`](/reference/api/search#sort):

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  'localhost:7700/indexes/products/search' \
  --data-binary '{
    "q": "kitchen utensils",
    "hybrid": {
      "semanticRatio": 0.9,
      "embedder": "default"
    },
    "filter": "price < 10",
    "sort": ["price:asc"]
  }'
```

### Vector search with user-provided embeddings

Use the `vector` search parameter to perform vector searches:

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  'localhost:7700/indexes/products/search' \
  --data-binary '{ "vector": [0, 1, 2] }'
```

`vector` must be an array of numbers indicating the search vector. You must generate these yourself when using vector search with user-provided embeddings.

`vector` can be used together with [other search parameters](/reference/api/search), including [`filter`](/reference/api/search#filter) and [`sort`](/reference/api/search#sort):

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  'localhost:7700/indexes/products/search' \
  --data-binary '{
    "vector": [0, 1, 2],
    "filter": "price < 10",
    "sort": ["price:asc"]
  }'
```

## Deactivate vector search

Manually remove all embedder configuration from your index:

```sh
curl \
  -X DELETE 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings/embedders' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

<Capsule intent="warning">
If you don't remove all embedders, Meilisearch will continue auto-generating embeddings for you documents. This will happen even if `vectorStore` has been set to `false` and may lead to unexpected expenses when using OpenAI's paid tiers.
</Capsule>

If using Meilisearch Cloud, navigate to your project overview and find "Experimental features", then uncheck the "vector store" box.

Alternatively, use [the `/experimental` route](/reference/api/experimental_features):

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "vectorStore": false
  }'
```
