# Vector search

Vector search is an experimental technology that uses Large Language Models to retrieve search results. This feature is useful when you are interested in results based on the meaning and context of a query, such as suggesting related products in webshop or articles in an online magazine. [Meilisearch Cloud](https://www.meilisearch.com/cloud?utm_campaign=oss&utm_source=docs&utm_medium=vector-search) is the most robust way of using vector search.
