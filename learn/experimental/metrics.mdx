This information can then be used to optimize an application's performance, troubleshoot issues, or improve the overall reliability of a system.

<Capsule intent="warning">
`/metrics` is an experimental feature. Experimental features are unstable: their API might significantly change and become incompatible between releases. Meilisearch does not recommend using experimental features in a production environment.

Meilisearch makes experimental features available expecting they will become stable in a future release. However, it is not possible to guarantee when and if this will happen.
