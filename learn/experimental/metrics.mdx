# Metrics

The `/metrics` endpoint exposes data compatible with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). You can monitor this endpoint to gain valuable insight into Meilisearch's behavior and performance. This information can then be used to optimize an application's performance, troubleshoot issues, or improve the overall reliability of a system.

<Capsule intent="warning">
`/metrics` is an experimental feature. Experimental features are unstable: their API might significantly change and become incompatible between releases. Meilisearch does not recommend using experimental features in a production environment.

Meilisearch makes experimental features available expecting they will become stable in a future release. However, it is not possible to guarantee when and if this will happen.
