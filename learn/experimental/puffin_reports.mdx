# Puffin reports

Puffin is an instrumentation profiler for Rust applications. Use this feature when trying to diagnose performance issues during indexing. Avoid enabling Puffin reports in production, as it might affect the performance and memory usage of other Meilisearch operations.

<Capsule intent="warning">
Exporting Puffin reports is an experimental feature. Experimental features are unstable: their API might significantly change and become incompatible between releases. Meilisearch does not recommend using experimental features in a production environment.

Meilisearch makes experimental features available expecting they will become stable in a future release. However, it is not possible to guarantee when and if this will happen.
