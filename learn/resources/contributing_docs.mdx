This documentation website is hosted in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation). It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), and deployed on [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com).

## Our documentation philosophy

Our documentation aims to be:

- **Efficient**: we don't want to waste anyone's time
- **Accessible**: reading the texts here shouldn't require native English or a computer science degree
- **Thorough**: the documentation website should contain all information anyone needs to use Meilisearch
- **Open source**: this is a resource by Meilisearch users, for Meilisearch users

## How to contribute?

Both options below require a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). Create one if you don't have it yet.

The two most common ways to contribute are:

1. **Opening an [issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues/new)** — to report a problem, request an improvement, or suggest new content
2. **Updating the documentation content by opening a Pull Request (PR)** — either by creating the PR from your local text editor, or directly from GitHub. Before opening a PR, check our [open issues](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues) to see if one already exists for your change. In most cases, it's a good idea to [open an issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues/new) first so you can coordinate with the maintainers.

### Creating a PR from your local editor

To edit the docs in your preferred editor and open a PR, follow the detailed instructions in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Editing content directly on GitHub

The simplest way to update the docs is to use the "Edit this page" link at the bottom left of every page. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the documentation page you'd like to edit, scroll down, and click **"Edit this page"** at the bottom left of the screen. This will take you to GitHub
2. You may be prompted to [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
3. Use GitHub's text editor to update the page
4. Scroll down until you reach the box named **"Propose changes"**
5. Fill in the first field with a short, descriptive title (e.g. "Fix typo in search API reference")
6. Use the second field to add a brief explanation of your changes
7. Click **"Propose changes"**. You should see a "Comparing changes" page
8. Check that the base repository is `meilisearch/documentation` and the base branch is `main`
9. Click **"Create pull request"**
10. A documentation maintainer will review your PR shortly. If everything looks good, your changes will be merged and published. You're now a Meilisearch contributor! 🚀

## How we review contributions

### How we review issues

When **reviewing issues**, we consider a few criteria:

1. Is this task a priority for the documentation maintainers?
2. Is the documentation website the best place for this information? Sometimes an idea might work better on our blog than the docs, or it might be more effective to link to an external resource than write and maintain it ourselves
3. If it's a bug report, can we reproduce the error?

If users show interest in an issue by upvoting or reporting similar problems, it is more likely the documentation will dedicate resources to that task.

### How we review PRs

For **reviewing contributor PRs**, we start by making sure the PR is up to our **quality standard**.

We ask the following questions:

1. Is the information **accurate**?
2. Is it **easy to understand**?
3. Do the code samples run without errors? Do they help users understand what we are explaining?
4. Is the English **clear and concise**? Can a non-native speaker understand it?
5. Is the grammar perfect? Are there any typos?
6. Can we shorten text **without losing any important information**?
7. Do the suggested changes require updating other pages in the documentation website?
8. In the case of new content, is the article in the right place? Should other articles in the documentation link to it?

Nothing makes us happier than a thoughtful and helpful PR. Your PRs often save us time and effort, and they make the documentation **even stronger**.

Our only major requirement for PR contributions is that the author responds to communication requests within a reasonable time frame.

Once you've opened a PR in this repository, one of our team members will stop by shortly to review it. If your PR is approved, nothing further is required from you. However, **if in seven days you have not responded to a request for further changes or more information, we will consider the PR abandoned and close it**.

If this happens to you and you think there has been some mistake, please let us know and we will try to rectify the situation.
