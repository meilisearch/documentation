# Using task webhooks

This guide teaches you how to use webhooks to notify a URL when Meilisearch completed a [task](/learn/async/asynchronous_operations).

## Requirements

- a command-line console
- a self-hosted Meilisearch instance
- a server configured to receive `POST` requests with an ndjson payload

## Configure the webhook URL

Restart your Meilisearch instance and provide the webhook URL to `--task-webhook-URL`:

```sh
meilisearch --task-webhook-url http://localhost:8000
```

You may also define the webhook URL with environment variables or in the configuration file with `MEILI_TASK_WEBHOOK_URL`.

## Optional: configure an authorization header

Depending on your setup, you may need to provide an authorization header. Provide it to `task-webhook-authorization-header`:

```sh
meilisearch --task-webhook-url http://localhost:8000 --task-webhook-authorization-header Bearer aSampleMasterKey
```

## Test the webhook

A common asynchronous operation is adding or updating documents to an index. The following example adds a test document to our `books` index:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/books/documents' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '[
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Nuestra parte de noche",
      "author": "Mariana Enríquez"
    }
  ]'
```

When Meilisearch finishes indexing this document, it will send a `POST` request the URL you configured with `--task-webhook-url`. The request body will be one or more task objects in [ndjson](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec) format:

```ndjson
{"uid":4,"indexUid":"books","status":"succeeded","type":"documentAdditionOrUpdate","canceledBy":null,"details.receivedDocuments":1,"details.indexedDocuments":1,"duration":"PT0.001192S","enqueuedAt":"2022-08-04T12:28:15.159167Z","startedAt":"2022-08-04T12:28:15.161996Z","finishedAt":"2022-08-04T12:28:15.163188Z"}
```

If Meilisearch has batched multiple tasks, it will only trigger the webhook once all tasks in a batch are finished. In this case, the response payload will include all tasks, each separated by a new line:

```ndjson
{"uid":4,"indexUid":"books","status":"succeeded","type":"documentAdditionOrUpdate","canceledBy":null,"details.receivedDocuments":1,"details.indexedDocuments":1,"duration":"PT0.001192S","enqueuedAt":"2022-08-04T12:28:15.159167Z","startedAt":"2022-08-04T12:28:15.161996Z","finishedAt":"2022-08-04T12:28:15.163188Z"}
{"uid":5,"indexUid":"books","status":"succeeded","type":"documentAdditionOrUpdate","canceledBy":null,"details.receivedDocuments":1,"details.indexedDocuments":1,"duration":"PT0.001192S","enqueuedAt":"2022-08-04T12:28:15.159167Z","startedAt":"2022-08-04T12:28:15.161996Z","finishedAt":"2022-08-04T12:28:15.163188Z"}
{"uid":6,"indexUid":"books","status":"succeeded","type":"documentAdditionOrUpdate","canceledBy":null,"details.receivedDocuments":1,"details.indexedDocuments":1,"duration":"PT0.001192S","enqueuedAt":"2022-08-04T12:28:15.159167Z","startedAt":"2022-08-04T12:28:15.161996Z","finishedAt":"2022-08-04T12:28:15.163188Z"}
```
