# Working with tasks

Many Meilisearch operations are processed asynchronously in a task. Asynchronous tasks allow you to make resource-intensive changes to your Meilisearch project without any downtime for users.

In this tutorial, you'll use the Meilisearch API to add documents to an index, and then monitor its status.

## Requirements

- a running Meilisearch project
- a command-line console

## Adding a task to the task queue

Operations that require indexing, such as adding and updating documents or changing an index settings, will always generate a task.

Start by creating an index, then add a large number of documents to this index:

<CodeSamples id="add_movies_json_1" />

Instead of processing your request immediately, Meilisearch will add it to a queue and return a summarized task object:

```json
{
  "taskUid": 0,
  "indexUid": "movies",
  "status": "enqueued",
  "type": "documentAdditionOrUpdate",
  "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-11T09:25:53.000000Z"
}
```

The summarized task object is confirmation your request has been accepted. It also gives you information you can use to monitor the status of your request, such as the `taskUid`.

You can add documents to a new Meilisearch Cloud index using the Cloud interface. To get the `taskUid` of this task, visit the "Task" overview and look for a "Document addition or update" task associated with your newly created index.
</Capsule>

## Monitoring task status

Meilisearch processes tasks in the order they were added to the queue. You can check the status of a task using the Meilisearch Cloud interface or the Meilisearch API.

### Monitoring task status in the Meilisearch Cloud interface

Log into your Meilisearch Cloud account and navigate to your project. Click the "Tasks" link in the project menu:

This will lead you to the task overview. Look for your request's `taskUid` in the "Uid" column:

When the task `status` changes to `succeeded`, Meilisearch has finished processing your request.

If the task `status` changes to `failed`, Meilisearch was not able to fulfill your request. Check the task object's `error` field for more information.

### Monitoring task status with the Meilisearch API

Use the `taskUid` from your request's response to check the status of a task:

<CodeSamples id="get_task_1" />

This will return the full task object:

```json
{
  "uid": 4,
  "indexUid" :"movie",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "type": "documentAdditionOrUpdate",
  "canceledBy": null,
  "details": {
    …
  },
  "error": null,
  "duration": "PT0.001192S",
  "enqueuedAt": "2022-08-04T12:28:15.159167Z",
  "startedAt": "2022-08-04T12:28:15.161996Z",
  "finishedAt": "2022-08-04T12:28:15.163188Z"
}
```

If the task is still `enqueued` or `processing`, wait a few moments and query the database once again.

When `status` changes to `succeeded`, Meilisearch has finished processing your request.

If the task `status` changes to `failed`, Meilisearch was not able to fulfill your request. Check the task object's `error` field for more information.

## Conclusion

You have seen what happens when an API request adds a task to the task queue, and how to check the status of a that task. Consult the API reference and the tasks explainer for more information on how tasks work.
