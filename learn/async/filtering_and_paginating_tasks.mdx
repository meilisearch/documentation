# Filtering and paginating tasks

## Filtering tasks

Querying the [get tasks endpoint](/reference/api/tasks#get-tasks) returns all tasks that have not been deleted. Use query parameters to filter tasks based on `uid`, `status`, `type`, `indexUid`, `canceledBy`, or date. Separate multiple values with a comma (`,`).

### Filter by `uid`

The following code sample returns tasks with `uid`s `5`, `10`, and `13`:

<CodeSamples id="async_guide_filter_by_ids_1" />

### Filter by `status`

The following code sample returns tasks with the `failed` and `canceled` statuses:

<CodeSamples id="async_guide_filter_by_statuses_1" />

### Filter by `type`

The following code sample returns `dumpCreation` and `indexSwap` tasks:

<CodeSamples id="async_guide_filter_by_types_1" />

### Filter by `indexUid`

The following command returns all tasks belonging to the index `movies`. Note that the `indexUid` is case-sensitive:

<CodeSamples id="async_guide_filter_by_index_uids_1" />

### Filter by `canceledBy`

Use the `canceledBy` filter to view all tasks canceled by one or more `taskCancelation` tasks:

<CodeSamples id="async_guide_canceled_by_1" />

### Filter by date

You can filter tasks by their `enqueuedAt`, `startedAt`, and `finishedAt` fields. To do so, prepend either `before` or `after` to each field name:

- `enqueuedAt` → `beforeEnqueuedAt` or `afterEnqueuedAt`
- `startedAt` → `beforeStartedAt` or `afterStartedAt`
- `finishedAt` →`beforeFinishedAt`  or `afterFinishedAt`

This filter accepts dates formatted according to [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt):

- `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
- `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+01:00`

<CodeSamples id="async_guide_filter_by_date_1" />

The above code sample will return all tasks `enqueued` **after** 11:49:53:00 on 11 Oct 2020.

<Capsule intent="note">
Date filters are equivalent to `<` or `>` operations and do not include the specified value. It is not possible to perform `≤` or `≥` operations with a task date filter.
</Capsule>

### Combine filters

You can combine task filters. Use the ampersand character (`&`) to combine filters, equivalent to a logical `AND`.

The following code sample returns all tasks in the `movies` index that have the type `documentAdditionOrUpdate` or `documentDeletion` and have the `status` of `processing`.

<CodeSamples id="async_guide_multiple_filters_1" />

**`OR` operations between different filters are not supported.** For example, you cannot view only tasks which have a type of `documentAddition` **or** a status of `failed`.

## Paginating tasks

By default, Meilisearch returns a list of 20 tasks for each request. You can adjust the number of tasks returned using the `limit` parameter, and control where the list begins using the `from` parameter.

For each call to this endpoint, the response will include the `next` field. When you call the endpoint again, pass this value as the `from` parameter to view the next set of results.

The following command returns two tasks at a time, starting from task `uid` `10`:

<CodeSamples id="get_all_tasks_paginating_1" />

**Response:**

```json
{
  "results": [
    …
  ],
  "limit": 2,
  "from": 10,
  "next": 8
}
```

To view the next set of results, you would repeat the same query, replacing the value of `from` with the value of `next`:

<CodeSamples id="get_all_tasks_paginating_2" />

When the returned value of `next` is `null`, you have reached the final set of results.
