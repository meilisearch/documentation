# Paginating tasks

By default, Meilisearch returns a list of 20 tasks for each request when you query the [get tasks endpoint](/reference/api/tasks#get-tasks). This guide shows you how to navigate the task list using query parameters.

<Capsule intent="tip" title="Paginating batches">
Paginating batches with [the `/batches` route](/reference/api/batches) follows the same rules as paginating tasks.
</Capsule>

## Configuring the number of returned tasks

Use the `limit` parameter to change the number of returned tasks:

<CodeSamples id="get_all_tasks_paginating_1" />

Meilisearch will return a batch of tasks. Each batch of returned tasks is often called a "page" of tasks, and the size of that page is determined by `limit`:  

```json
{
  "results": [
    …
  ],
  "total": 50,
  "limit": 2,
  "from": 10,
  "next": 8
}
```

It is possible none of the returned tasks are the ones you are looking for. In that case, you will need to use the [get all tasks request response](/reference/api/tasks#response) to navigate the results.

## Navigating the task list with `from` and `next`

Use the `next` value included in the response to your previous query together with `from` to fetch the next set of results:

<CodeSamples id="get_all_tasks_paginating_2" />

This will return a new batch of tasks:

```json
{
  "results": [
    …
  ],
  "total": 50,
  "limit": 2,
  "from": 8,
  "next": 6
}
```

When the value of `next` is `null`, you have reached the final set of results.

Use `from` and `limit` together with task filtering parameters to navigate filtered task lists.
