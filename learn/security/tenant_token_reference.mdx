# Tenant token payload reference

Meilisearch's tenant tokens are JSON web tokens (JWTs). Their payload is made of three elements: [search rules](#search-rules), an [API key UID](#api-key-uid), and an optional [expiration date](#expiry-date).

## Example payload

```json
{
  "exp": 1646756934,
  "apiKeyUid": "at5cd97d-5a4b-4226-a868-2d0eb6d197ab",
  "searchRules": {
    "INDEX_NAME": {
      "filter": "attribute = value"
    }
  }
}
```

## Search rules

The search rules object are a set of instructions defining search parameters Meilisearch will enforced in every query made with a specific tenant token.

### Search rules object

`searchRules` must be a JSON object. Each key must correspond to one or more indexes:

```json
{
  "searchRules": {
    "*": {},
    "INDEX_*": {},
    "INDEX_NAME_A": {}
  }
}
```

Each search rule object may contain a single `filter` key. This `filter`'s value must be a [filter expression](/learn/fine_tuning_results/filtering#filter-expressions):

```json
{
  "*": {
    "filter": "attribute_A = value_X AND attribute_B = value_Y"
  }
}
```

Meilisearch applies the filter to all searches made with that tenant token. A token only has access to the indexes present in the `searchRules` object.

A token may contain rules for any number of indexes. **Specific rulesets take precedence and overwrite `*` rules.**

<Capsule intent="danger">
Because tenant tokens are generated in your application, Meilisearch cannot check if search rule filters are valid. Invalid search rules return throw errors when searching.

Consult the search API reference for [more information on Meilisearch filter syntax](/reference/api/search#filter).
</Capsule>

The search rule may also be an empty object. In this case, the tenant token will have access to all documents in an index:

```json
{
  "INDEX_NAME": {}
}
```

### Examples

#### Single filter

In this example, the user will only receive `medical_records` documents whose `user_id` equals `1`:

```json
{
  "medical_records": {
    "filter": "user_id = 1"
  }
}
```

#### Multiple filters

In this example, the user will only receive `medical_records` documents whose `user_id` equals `1` and whose `published` field equals `true`:

```json
{
  "medical_records": {
    "filter": "user_id = 1 AND published = true"
  }
}
```

#### Give access to all documents in an index

In this example, the user has access to all documents in `medical_records`:

```json
{
  "medical_records": {}
}
```

#### Target multiple indexes with a partial wildcard

In this example, the user will receive documents from any index starting with `medical`. This includes indexes such as `medical_records` and `medical_patents`:

```json
{
  "medical*": {
    "filter": "user_id = 1"
  }
}
```

#### Target all indexes with a wildcard

In this example, the user will receive documents from any index in the whole instance:

```json
{
  "*": {
    "filter": "user_id = 1"
  }
}
```

### Target multiple indexes manually

In this example, the user has access to documents with `user_id = 1` for all indexes, except one. When querying `medical_records`, the user will only have access to published documents:

```json
{
  "*": {
    "filter": "user_id = 1"
  },
  "medical_records": {
    "filter": "user_id = 1 AND published = true",
  }
}
```

## API key UID

Tenant token payloads must include an API key UID to validate requests. The UID is an alphanumeric string identifying an API key:

```json
{
  "apiKeyUid": "at5cd97d-5a4b-4226-a868-2d0eb6d197ab"
}
```

Query the [get one API key endpoint](/reference/api/keys) to obtain an API key's UID.

The UID must indicate an API key with access to [the search action](/reference/api/keys#actions). A token has access to the same indexes and routes as the API key used to generate it.

Since a master key is not an API key, **you cannot use a master key to create a tenant token**. Avoid exposing API keys and **always generate tokens on your application's back end**.

<Capsule intent="warning" title="Tenant token and expired API keys">
If an API key expires, any tenant tokens created with it will become invalid. The same applies if the API key is deleted or regenerated due to a changed master key.
</Capsule>

## Expiry date

The expiry date must be a UNIX timestamp or `null`:

```json
{
  "exp": 1646756934
}
```

A token's expiration date cannot exceed its parent API key's expiration date.

Setting a token expiry date is optional, but highly recommended. Tokens without an expiry date remain valid indefinitely and may be a security liability.

<Capsule intent="danger" intent="Revoking a token without an expirty date">
The only way to revoke a token without an expiry date is to [delete](/reference/api/keys#delete-a-key) its parent API key.

Changing an instance's master key forces Meilisearch to regenerate all API keys and will also render all existing tenant tokens invalid.
