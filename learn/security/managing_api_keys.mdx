# Managing API keys

This guide shows you how to access and configure API keys.

## Accessing the `/keys` API route

You can access the [`/keys` route](/reference/api/keys) using the master key or an API key with access to the `keys.get`, `keys.create`, `keys.update`, or `keys.delete` actions.

## Updating an API key

You can only update the `name` and `description` of an API key, even after it expires.

For example, we can update the `Default Search API Key` and change its description:

<CodeSamples id="security_guide_update_key_1" />

```json
{
  "name": "Default Search API Key",
  "description": "Default Search API Key",
  "key": "d0552b41536279a0ad88bd595327b96f01176a60c2243e906c52ac02375f9bc4",
  "uid":"74c9c733-3368-4738-bbe5-1d18a5fecb37",
  "actions": [
    "search"
  ],
  "indexes": [
    "*"
  ],
  "expiresAt": null,
  "createdAt": "2022-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2022-01-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

To update an API key, you must use the [update API key endpoint](/reference/api/keys#update-a-key), which can only be accessed with the master key or an API key with the `keys.update` action.

Meilisearch supports partial updates with the `PATCH` route. This means your payload only needs to contain the data you want to update—in this case, `description`.

## Creating an API key

You can create API keys by using the [create key endpoint](/reference/api/keys#create-a-key). This endpoint is always protected and can only be accessed with the master key or an API key with the `keys.create` action.

Let's create a new API key so authorized users can search through out `patient_medical_records` index:

<CodeSamples id="security_guide_create_key_1" />

All [`/keys` endpoints](/reference/api/keys) are synchronous, so your key will be generated immediately:

```json
{
  "name": null,
  "description": "Search patient records key",
  "key": "d0552b41536279a0ad88bd595327b96f01176a60c2243e906c52ac02375f9bc4",
  "uid": "ac5cd97d-5a4b-4226-a868-2d0eb6d197ab",
  "actions": [
    "search"
  ],
  "indexes": [
    "patient_medical_records"
  ],
  "expiresAt": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "createdAt": "2022-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2022-01-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

It is good practice to always set an expiry date when creating a new API key. If you are sure this is not necessary in your application, you can create an API key with no expiry date by explicitly passing a `null` value to `expiresAt`.

## Listing API keys

You can use the [list keys endpoint](/reference/api/keys) to obtain information on any active key in your Meilisearch instance. This is useful when you need an overview of existing keys and their permissions.

By default, [`GET /keys`](/reference/api/keys#get-all-keys) returns the 20 most recently created keys. You can change this using the [`limit`](/reference/api/keys#get-all-keys) query parameter. **Expired keys will appear in the response, but deleted keys will not**. As with creating, deleting, and updating API keys, you either need the master key or an API key with the `keys.get` action to access this endpoint.

[`GET /keys/{key_or_uid}`](/reference/api/keys#get-one-key) returns information on a single key. `{key_or_uid}` should be replaced with the full `key` or `uid` value obtained during key creation.

We can query our instance to confirm which active keys can search our `patient_medical_records` index:

<CodeSamples id="security_guide_list_keys_1" />

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "name": "Default Search API Key",
      "description": "Use it to search from the frontend",
      "key": "d0552b41536279a0ad88bd595327b96f01176a60c2243e906c52ac02375f9bc4",
      "uid":"74c9c733-3368-4738-bbe5-1d18a5fecb37",
      "actions": [
        "search"
      ],
      "indexes": [
        "*"
      ],
      "expiresAt": null,
      "createdAt": "2022-01-01T10:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2022-01-01T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "name": "Default Admin API Key",
      "description": "Use it for all other than search operations. Caution! Do not expose it on a public frontend",
      "key": "380689dd379232519a54d15935750cc7625620a2ea2fc06907cb40ba5b421b6f",
      "uid": "20f7e4c4-612c-4dd1-b783-7934cc038213",
      "actions": [
        "*"
      ],
      "indexes": [
        "*"
      ],
      "expiresAt": null,
      "createdAt": "2021-08-11T10:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2021-08-11T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "name": null,
      "description": "Search patient records key",
      "key": "d0552b41536279a0ad88bd595327b96f01176a60c2243e906c52ac02375f9bc4",
      "uid": "ac5cd97d-5a4b-4226-a868-2d0eb6d197ab",
      "actions": [
        "search"
      ],
      "indexes": [
        "patient_medical_records"
      ],
      "expiresAt": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "createdAt": "2022-01-01T10:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2022-01-01T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "offset":0,
  "limit":20,
  "total":3
}
```

## Deleting an API key

If a key is no longer useful or has been compromised, you can use [delete key endpoint](/reference/api/keys#delete-a-key) to disable it before its expiry date.

If we accidentally exposed our `Search patient records key`, we can delete it to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to our `patient_medical_records` index:

<CodeSamples id="security_guide_delete_key_1" />

## Expired keys

Once a key is past its `expiresAt` date, using it for API authorization will return an error. Expired keys will still be returned by the [list keys endpoint](/reference/api/keys#get-all-keys).

## Retrieving the value of an API key

The [`key`](/reference/api/keys#key) field is generated by hashing the master key and the [`uid`](/reference/api/keys#uid). As a result, `key` values are deterministic between instances sharing the same configuration. 

You can determine the value of an API key with the following command, replacing `HYPHENATED_UUID` and `MASTER_KEY` with the correct values for your key and instance:

```sh
echo -n $HYPHENATED_UUID | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac $MASTER_KEY
```

<Capsule intent="note" title="API keys and backups">
Since the `key` field depends on the master key, it is not propagated to dumps and snapshots. If a malicious user ever gets access to your dumps or snapshots, they will not have access to your instance's API keys.
