# Resetting the master key

This guide shows you how to manage the master key in Meilisearch Cloud and self-hosted instances. Resetting the master key may be necessary if an unauthorized party obtains access to your master key.

## Resetting the master key in Meilisearch Cloud

Meilisearch Cloud does not give users control over the master key. If you need to change your master key, contact support through the Cloud interface or on the official [Meilisearch Discord server](https://discord.meilisearch.com).

<Capsule intent="danger">
Resetting the master key automatically invalidates all API keys. Meilisearch Cloud will generate new default API keys automatically.
</Capsule>

## Resetting the master key in self-hosted instances

To reset your master key in a self-hosted instance, relaunch your instance and pass a new value to `--master-key` or `MEILI_MASTER_KEY`.
