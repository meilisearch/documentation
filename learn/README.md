## Our philosophy

Meilisearch has been developed to provide an **easily integrated search solution** with a **simple and intuitive implementation process**. If you're an experienced developer looking to dive right in, we encourage you to check out our [API references](/reference/api).

However, if you prefer a more guided or hands-on approach, you're not alone! We offer descriptions of all of Meilisearch's [core concepts](/learn/core_concepts), as well as a [getting started guide](/learn/getting_started) that should teach you everything you need to start creating your own projects.
