## Easy to Learn, Fun to Master

It is our fondest hope that anyone could learn the basics simply by looking at our [API endpoints](/reference/api) or [feature references](/reference/features).

However, if you prefer a more guided or hands-on approach, you're in the right place. We offer helpful descriptions of all of MeiliSearch's [core concepts](/learn/core_concepts), as well as a [beginner-focused tutorial](/learn/tutorials) that should teach you everything you need to start [creating your own projects](/create).
