Meilisearch officially supports Windows, MacOS, and many Linux distributions. Consult the [installation guide](/learn/self_hosted/install_meilisearch_locally) for more instructions.

Meilisearch binaries might still run in supported environments without official support.

<Tip>
Use [Meilisearch Cloud](https://www.meilisearch.com/cloud) to integrate Meilisearch with applications hosted in unsupported operating systems.
</Tip>

## Linux

The Meilisearch binary works on all Linux distributions with `amd64/x86_64` or `aarch64/arm64` architecture using glibc 2.35 and later. You can check your glibc version using:

```
ldd --version
```

## macOS

The Meilisearch binary works with macOS 14 Sonoma and later with `amd64` or `arm64` architecture. Older macOS versions might be compatible with Meilisearch but are not officially supported.

## Windows

The Meilisearch binary works on Windows Server 2022 and later.

It is likely the Meilisearch binary also works with Windows OS 10 and later. However, due to the differences between Windows OS and Windows Server, Meilisearch does not officially support Windows OS.

## Troubleshooting

If the provided [binaries](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/releases) do not work on your operating system, try building Meilisearch [from source](/learn/self_hosted/install_meilisearch_locally#local-installation). If compilation fails, Meilisearch is not compatible with your machine.
