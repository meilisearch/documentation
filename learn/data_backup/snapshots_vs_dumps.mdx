# Snapshots and dumps

This article explains Meilisearch's two backup methods: snapshots and dumps.

## Snapshots

A snapshot is an exact copy of the Meilisearch database, located by default in `./data.ms`. [Use snapshots for quick and efficient backups of your instance](/learn/advanced/snapshots).

The documents in a snapshot are already indexed and ready to go, greatly increasing import speed. However, snapshots are not compatible between different versions of Meilisearch.

In short, snapshots are safeguard: if something goes wrong in an instance, you're able to recover and relaunch your database quickly. You can also schedule periodic snapshot creation.

## Dumps

A dump isn't an exact copy of your database like a snapshot. Instead, it is closer to a blueprint which Meilisearch can later use to recreate a whole instance from scratch.

Importing a dump requires Meilisearch to re-index all documents. This process uses a significant amount of time and memory proportional to the size of the database. Compared to the snapshots, importing a dump is a slow and inefficient operation.

At the same time, dumps are not bound to a specific Meilisearch version. This means dumps are ideal for migrating your data when you upgrade Meilisearch.

<Capsule intent="note">
Use dumps to transfer data from an old Meilisearch version into a more recent release. Do not transfer data from a new release into a legacy Meilisearch version.

For example, you can import a dump from Meilisearch v1.2 into v1.6 without any problems. Importing a dump generated in v1.7 into a v1.2 instance, however, can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Snapshots VS dumps

Both snapshots and dumps are data backups, but they serve different purposes.

Snapshots are highly efficient, but not portable between different versions of Meilisearch. **Use snapshots for periodic data backups.**

Dumps are portable between different Meilisearch versions, but not very efficient. **Use dumps when updating to a new Meilisearch release.**
