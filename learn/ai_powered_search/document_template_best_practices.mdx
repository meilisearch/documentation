# Document template best practices

When using AI-powered search, Meilisearch generates prompts by filling in your embedder's `documentTemplate` with each document's data. The better your prompt is, the more relevant your search results.

This guide shows you what to do and what to avoid when writing a `documentTemplate`.

## Sample document

It's easier to understand the impact of a good `documentTemplate` by seeing it applied to a document. Take a look at this document from a database of movies:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "title": "Ariel",
  "overview": "Taisto Kasurinen is a Finnish coal miner whose father has just committed suicide and who is framed for a crime he did not commit. In jail, he starts to dream about leaving the country and starting a new life. He escapes from prison but things don't go as planned...",
  "genres": [
    "Drama",
    "Crime",
    "Comedy"
  ],
  "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/ojDg0PGvs6R9xYFodRct2kdI6wC.jpg",
  "release_date": 593395200
}
```

## Do not use the default `documentTemplate`

Always use a custom `documentTemplate` value in your embedder configuration.

When using the default `documentTemplate`, Meilisearch includes all searchable fields with non-`null` values. In most cases that is too much information for the embedder.

## Only include highly relevant information

Take a look at your document and identify the most relevant fields:

```
"A movie called {{doc.title}} about {{doc.overview}}"
```

`poster` and `id` contain data that has little semantic importance and can be safely excluded. The data in `genres` and `release_date` is very useful for filters, but say little about this specific film.

This leaves two relevant fields: `title` and `overview`.

## Keep prompts short

For the best results, keep prompts somewhere between 15 and 45 words:

```
"A movie called {{doc.title}} about {{doc.overview | truncatewords: 20}}"
```

In the sample document, the `overview` alone is 49 words. Use Liquid's [`truncate`](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/truncate/) or [`truncatewords`](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/truncatewords/) to shorten it.

Short prompts don't contain enough information for the embedder to properly understand the query context. The same happens with long prompts: too much information makes it hard for the embedder to identify what is relevant about a document.

## Conclusion

In this article you saw the main steps to generating prompts that lead to relevant AI-powered search results: 

- do not use the default `documentTemplate`
- only include relevant data
- truncate long fields
