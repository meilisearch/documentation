This guide shows how to perform AI-powered searches with user-generated embeddings instead of relying on a third-party tool.

## Requirements

- A Meilisearch project with AI-powered search activated

## Configure a custom embedder

Configure the `embedder` index setting, settings its source to `userProvided`:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "embedders": {
      "image2text": {
        "source":  "userProvided",
        "dimensions": 3
      }
    }
  }'
```

## Add documents to Meilisearch

Next, use [the `/documents` endpoint](/reference/api/documents?utm_campaign=vector-search&utm_source=docs&utm_medium=vector-search-guide) to upload vectorized documents. Place vector data in your documents' `_vectors` field:

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
'localhost:7700/indexes/products/documents' \
--data-binary '[
    { "id": 0, "_vectors": {"image2text": [0, 0.8, -0.2]}, "text": "frying pan" },
    { "id": 1, "_vectors": {"image2text": [1, -0.2, 0]}, "text": "baking dish" }
]'
```

## Vector search with user-provided embeddings

When using a custom embedder, you must vectorize both your documents and user queries.

Once you have the query's vector, pass it to the `vector` search parameter to perform an AI-powered search:

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  'localhost:7700/indexes/products/search' \
  --data-binary '{ "vector": [0, 1, 2] }'
```

`vector` must be an array of numbers indicating the search vector. You must generate these yourself when using vector search with user-provided embeddings.

`vector` can be used together with [other search parameters](/reference/api/search?utm_campaign=vector-search&utm_source=docs&utm_medium=vector-search-guide), including [`filter`](/reference/api/search#filter) and [`sort`](/reference/api/search#sort):

```sh
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  'localhost:7700/indexes/products/search' \
  --data-binary '{
    "vector": [0, 1, 2],
    "filter": "price < 10",
    "sort": ["price:asc"]
  }'
```
