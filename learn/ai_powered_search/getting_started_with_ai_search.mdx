# Getting started with AI-powered search <NoticeTag type="experimental" label="experimental" />

[AI-powered search](https://meilisearch.com/solutions/vector-search), sometimes also called vector search or hybrid search, is an experimental technology that uses [large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) to retrieve search results based on the meaning and context of a query.

This tutorial will walk you through configuring AI-powered search in your Meilisearch project. You will see how to activate this feature, generate document embeddings with OpenAI, and perform your first search.

## Requirements

- A running Meilisearch project
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- A command-line console

## Create a new index

First, create a new Meilisearch project. If this is your first time using Meilisearch, follow the [quick start](/learn/getting_started/cloud_quick_start) then come back to this tutorial.

Next, create a `kitchenware` index and add [this kitchenware products dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/datasets/kitchenware.json) to it. It will take Meilisearch a few moments to process your request, but you can continue to the next step while your data is indexing.

## Activate AI-powered search

AI-powered search is an experimental feature and is disabled by default. You must manually activate it either via the Meilisearch Cloud UI, or with the experimental features endpoint.

To use AI-powered search with Meilisearch Cloud, you must first enter the waitlist. You will not be able to activate vector search until your sign-up has been approved.

### Meilisearch Cloud UI

Navigate to your project overview and find "Experimental features". Then click on the "AI-powered search" box.

![A section of the project overview interface titled "Experimental features". The image shows a few options, including "Vector store".](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/images/vector-search/01-cloud-vector-store.png)

### Experimental features endpoint

Use [the `/experimental-features` route](/reference/api/experimental_features) to activate vector search during runtime:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "vectorStore": true
  }'
```

Replace `MEILISEARCH_URL` with your project's URL. In most cases, this should look like `https://ms-000xx00x000-xx.xxx.meilisearch.io` if you're using Meilisearch Cloud, or `http://localhost:7700` if you are running Meilisearch in your local machine.

## Generate embeddings with OpenAI

In this step, you will configure an OpenAI embedder. Meilisearch uses **embedders** to translate documents into **embeddings**, which are mathematical representations of a document's meaning and context.

Open a blank file in your text editor. You will only use this file to build your embedder one step at a time, so there's no need to save it if you plan to finish the tutorial in one sitting.

### Choose an embedder name

In your blank file, create your `embedder` object:

```json
{
  "products-openai": {}
}
```

`products-openai` is the name of your embedder for this tutorial. You can name embedders any way you want, but try to keep it simple, short, and easy to remember.

### Choose an embedder source

Meilisearch relies on third-party services to generate embeddings. These services are often referred to as the embedder source.

Add a new `source` field to your embedder object:

```json
{
  "products-openai": {
    "source": "openai"
  }
}
```

Meilisearch supports several embedder sources. This tutorial uses OpenAI because it is a good option that fits most use cases.

### Choose an embedder model

Models supply the information required for embedders to process your documents.

Add a new `model` field to your embedder object:

```json
{
  "products-openai": {
    "source": "openai",
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small"
  }
}
```

Each embedder service supports different models targeting specific use cases. `text-embedding-3-small` is a cost-effective model for general usage.

### Create your API key

Log into OpenAI, or create an account if this is your first time using it. Generate a new API key using [OpenAI's web interface](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

Add the `apiKey` field to your embedder:

```json
{
  "products-openai": {
    "source": "openai",
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "apiKey": "OPEN_AI_API_KEY",
  }
}
```

Replace `OPEN_AI_API_KEY` with your own API key.

<Capsule intent="tip" title="OpenAI key tiers">
You may use any key tier for this tutorial. Use at least [Tier 2 keys](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers?context=tier-two) in production environments.
</Capsule>

### Design a prompt template

Meilisearch embedders only accept textual input, but documents can be complex objects containing different types of data. This means you must convert your documents into a single text field. Meilisearch uses [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/), an open-source templating language to help you do that.

A good template should be short and only include the most important information about a document. Add the following `documentTemplate` to your embedder:

```json
{
  "products-openai": {
    "source": "openai",
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "apiKey": "OPEN_AI_API_KEY",
    "documentTemplate": "An object used in a kitchen named '{{doc.name}}'"
  }
}
```

This template starts by giving the general context of the document: `An object used in a kitchen`. Then it adds the information that is specific to each document: `doc` represents your document, and you can access any of its attributes using dot notation. `name` is an attribute with values such as `wooden spoon` or `rolling pin`. Since it is present in all documents in this dataset and describes the product in few words, it is a good choice to include in the template.

### Create the embedder

Your embedder object is ready. Send it to Meilisearch by updating your index settings:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/indexes/kitchenware/settings/embedders' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "products-openai": {
      "source": "openAi",
      "apiKey": "OPEN_AI_API_KEY",
      "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
      "documentTemplate": "An object used in a kitchen named '{{doc.name}}'"
    }
  }'
```

Replace `MEILISEARCH_URL` with the address of your Meilisearch project, and `OPEN_AI_API_KEY` with your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

Meilisearch and OpenAI will start processing your documents and updating your index. This may take a few moments, but once it's done you are ready to perform an AI-powered search.

## Perform an AI-powered search

AI-powered searches are very similar to basic text searches. You must query the `/search` endpoint with a request containing both the `q` and the `hybrid` parameters:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST 'MEILISEARCH_URL/indexes/kitchenware/search' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "q": "kitchen utensils made of wood",
    "hybrid": {
      "embedder": "products-openai"
    }
  }'
```

For this tutorial, `hybrid` is an object with a single `embedder` field.

Meilisearch will then return an equal mix of semantic and full-text matches.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have created an index, added a small dataset to it, and activated AI-powered search. You then used OpenAI to generate embeddings out of your documents, and performed your first AI-powered search.

## Next steps

Now you have a basic overview of the basic steps required for setting up and performing AI-powered searches, you might want to try and implement this feature in your own application.

For practical information on implementing AI-powered search with other services, consult our [guides section](/guides/ai/openai). There you will find specific instructions for embedders such as [LangChain](/guides/ai/langchain) and [Cloudflare](/guides/ai/cloudflare).

For more in-depth information, consult the API reference for [embedder settings](/reference/api/settings#embedders-experimental) and [the `hybrid` search parameter](/reference/api/search#hybrid-search-experimental).
