# Getting started with AI-powered search <NoticeTag type="experimental" label="experimental" />

[AI-powered search](https://meilisearch.com/solutions/vector-search), sometimes also called vector search or hybrid search, is an experimental technology that uses [large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) to retrieve search results based on the meaning and context of a query.

This tutorial will walk you through configuring AI-powered search in your Meilisearch project. You will see how to activate this feature, generate document embeddings with OpenAI, and perform your first search.

## Requirements

- A running Meilisearch project
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- A command-line console

## Create a new index

First, create a new Meilisearch project. If this is your first time using Meilisearch, follow the [quick start](/learn/getting_started/cloud_quick_start) then come back to this tutorial.

Next, create a `kitchenware` index and add [this kitchenware products dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/datasets/kitchenware.json) to it. It will take Meilisearch a few moments to process your request, but you can continue to the next step while your data is indexing.

## Activate AI-powered search

AI-powered search is an experimental feature and is disabled by default. You must manually activate it either via the Meilisearch Cloud UI, or with the experimental features endpoint.

<Capsule intent="tip" title="Meilisearch Cloud AI-powered search waitlist">
To use AI-powered search with Meilisearch Cloud, you must first enter the waitlist. You will not be able to activate vector search until your sign-up has been approved.

### Meilisearch Cloud UI

Navigate to your project overview and find "Experimental features". Then click on the "AI-powered search" box.

![A section of the project overview interface titled "Experimental features". The image shows a few options, including "Vector store".](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/images/vector-search/01-cloud-vector-store.png)

### Experimental features endpoint

Use [the `/experimental-features` route](/reference/api/experimental_features) to activate vector search during runtime:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "vectorStore": true
  }'
```

Replace `MEILISEARCH_URL` with your project's URL. In most cases, this should look like `https://ms-000xx00x000-xx.xxx.meilisearch.io` if you're using Meilisearch Cloud, or `http://localhost:7700` if you are running Meilisearch in your local machine.

## Generate embeddings with OpenAI

In this step, you will configure an OpenAI embedder. Meilisearch uses **embedders** to translate documents into **embeddings**, which are mathematical representations of a document's meaning and context.

Open a blank file in your text editor. You will only use this file to build your embedder one step at a time, so there's no need to save it if you plan to finish the tutorial in one sitting.

### Choose an embedder name

In your blank file, create your `embedder` object:

```json
{
  "products-openai": {}
}
```

`products-openai` is the name of your embedder for this tutorial. You can name embedders any way you want, but try to keep it simple, short, and easy to remember.

### Choose an embedder source

Meilisearch relies on third-party services to generate embeddings. These services are often referred to as the embedder source.

Add a new `source` field to your embedder object:

```json
{
  "products-openai": {
    "source": "openai"
  }
}
```

Meilisearch supports several embedder sources. This tutorial uses OpenAI because it is a good option that fits most use cases.

### Choose an embedder model

Models supply the information required for embedders to process your documents.

Add a new `model` field to your embedder object:

```json
{
  "products-openai": {
    "source": "openai",
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small"
  }
}
```

Each embedder service supports different models targeting specific use cases. `text-embedding-3-small` is a cost-effective model for general usage.

### Create your API key

Log into OpenAI, or create an account if this is your first time using it. Generate a new API key using [OpenAI's web interface](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

Add the `apiKey` field to your embedder:

```json
{
  "products-openai": {
    "source": "openai",
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "apiKey": "OPEN_AI_API_KEY",
  }
}
```

Replace `OPEN_AI_API_KEY` with your own API key.

<Capsule intent="tip" title="OpenAI key tiers">
You may use any key tier for this tutorial. Use at least [Tier 2 keys](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers?context=tier-two) in production environments.
</Capsule>

### Design a prompt template

Meilisearch embedders only accept textual input, but documents can be complex objects containing different types of data. This means you must convert your documents into a single text field. Meilisearch uses [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/), an open-source templating language to help you do that.

A good template should be short and only include the most important information about a document. Add the following `documentTemplate` to your embedder:

```json
{
  "products-openai": {
    "source": "openai",
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "apiKey": "OPEN_AI_API_KEY",
    "documentTemplate": "An object used in a kitchen named '{{doc.name}}'"
  }
}
```

This template starts by giving the general context of the document: `An object used in a kitchen`. Then it adds the information that is specific to each document: `doc` represents your document, and you can access any of its attributes using dot notation. `name` is an attribute with values such as `wooden spoon` or `rolling pin`. Since it is present in all documents in this dataset and describes the product in few words, it is a good choice to include in the template.

### Create the embedder

Your embedder object is ready. Send it to Meilisearch by updating your index settings:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/indexes/kitchenware/settings/embedders' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "products-openai": {
      "source": "openAi",
      "apiKey": "OPEN_AI_API_KEY",
      "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
      "documentTemplate": "An object used in a kitchen named '{{doc.name}}'"
    }
  }'
```

Replace `MEILISEARCH_URL` with the address of your Meilisearch project, and `OPEN_AI_API_KEY` with your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

Meilisearch and OpenAI will start processing your documents and updating your index. This may take a few moments, but once it's done you are ready to perform an AI-powered search.

## Perform an AI-powered search

AI-powered searches are very similar to basic text searches. You must query the `/search` endpoint with a request containing both the `q` and the `hybrid` parameters:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST 'MEILISEARCH_URL/indexes/kitchenware/search' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "q": "kitchen utensils made of wood",
    "hybrid": {
      "embedder": "products-openai"
    }
  }'
```

For this tutorial, `hybrid` is an object with a single `embedder` field.

Meilisearch will then return an equal mix of semantic and full-text matches.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have created an index, added a small dataset to it, and activated AI-powered search. You then used OpenAI to generate embeddings out of your documents, and performed your first AI-powered search.

## Next steps

Now you have a basic overview of the basic steps required for setting up and performing AI-powered searches, you might want to try and implement this feature in your own application.

For practical information on implementing AI-powered search with other services, consult our [guides section](/guides/ai/openai). There you will find specific instructions for embedders such as [LangChain](/guides/ai/langchain) and [Cloudflare](/guides/ai/cloudflare).

For more in-depth information, consult the API reference for [embedder settings](/reference/api/settings#embedders-experimental) and [the `hybrid` search parameter](/reference/api/search#hybrid-search-experimental).
