# Deactivate vector search

This guide shows how to disable Meilisearch's AI-powered search.

## Remove embedder configuration

Manually remove all embedder configuration from your index:

```sh
curl \
  -X DELETE 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/movies/settings/embedders' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

<Capsule intent="danger">
If you don't remove all configured embedders, Meilisearch will continue auto-generating embeddings for you documents. This will happen even if `vectorStore` has been set to `false` and may lead to unexpected expenses when using OpenAI's paid tiers.
</Capsule>

## Disable the vector store

If using Meilisearch Cloud, navigate to your project overview and find "Experimental features", then uncheck the "Vector store" box.

Alternatively, use [the `/experimental` route](/reference/api/experimental_features?utm_campaign=vector-search&utm_source=docs&utm_medium=vector-search-guide):

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "vectorStore": false
  }'
```
