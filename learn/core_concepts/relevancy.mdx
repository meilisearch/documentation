# Relevancy

**Relevancy** refers to the accuracy and effectiveness of search results. If search results are almost always appropriate, then they can be considered relevant, and vice versa.

Meilisearch has a number of features for fine-tuning the relevancy of search results. The most important tool among them is **ranking rules**.

## Ranking rules

In order to ensure relevant results, search responses are sorted based on a set of consecutive rules called **ranking rules**.

### Behavior

Each index possesses a list of ranking rules stored as an array in the [settings object](/reference/api/settings). This array is **fully customizable**, meaning you can **delete existing rules, add new ones, and reorder them as needed**.

Meilisearch uses a [bucket sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort) algorithm to rank documents whenever a search query is made. The first ranking rule applies to all documents, while each subsequent rule is only applied to documents considered equal under the previous rule as a tiebreaker.

**The order in which ranking rules are applied matters.** The first rule in the array has the most impact, and the last rule has the least. Our default configuration meets most standard needs, but [you can change it](/reference/api/settings#update-ranking-rules).

Deleting a rule means that Meilisearch will no longer sort results based on that rule. For example, **if you delete the [typo ranking rule](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy#_2-typo), documents with typos will still be considered during search**, but they will no longer be sorted by increasing number of typos.

### Built-in rules

Meilisearch contains six built-in ranking rules in the following order:

```json
[
  "words",
  "typo",
  "proximity",
  "attribute",
  "sort",
  "exactness"
]
```

Depending on your needs, you might want to change this order. To do so, you can use the [update settings endpoint](/reference/api/settings#update-settings) or [update ranking rules endpoint](/reference/api/settings#update-ranking-rules).

#### 1. Words

Results are sorted by **decreasing number of matched query terms**. Returns documents that contain all query terms first.

<Capsule intent="note">
The `words` rule works from right to left. Therefore, the order of the query string impacts the order of results.

For example, if someone were to search `batman dark knight`, the `words` rule would rank documents containing all three terms first, documents containing only `batman` and `dark` second, and documents containing only `batman` third.
</Capsule>

#### 2. Typo

Results are sorted by **increasing number of typos**. Returns documents that match query terms with fewer typos first.

#### 3. Proximity

Results are sorted by **increasing distance between matched query terms**. Returns documents where query terms occur close together and in the same order as the query string first.

#### 4. Attribute

Results are sorted according to the **[attribute ranking order](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy#attribute-ranking-order)**. Returns documents that contain query terms in more important attributes first.

Also, note the documents with attributes containing the query words at the beginning of the attribute will be considered more relevant than documents containing the query words at the end of the attributes.

#### 5. Sort

Results are sorted **according to parameters decided at query time**. When the `sort` ranking rule is in a higher position, sorting is exhaustive: results will be less relevant but follow the user-defined sorting order more closely. When `sort` is in a lower position, sorting is relevant: results will be very relevant but might not always follow the order defined by the user.

<Capsule intent="note">
Differently from other ranking rules, sort is only active for queries containing the [`sort` search parameter](/reference/api/search#sort). If a search request does not contain `sort`, or if its value is invalid, this rule will be ignored.
</Capsule>

#### 6. Exactness

Results are sorted by **the similarity of the matched words with the query words**. Returns documents that contain exactly the same terms as the ones queried first.

#### Examples

<Tabs.Container labels={["Typo", "Proximity", "Attribute"]}>

<Tabs.Content label="Typo">

![Demonstrating the typo ranking rule by searching for 'vogli'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/.vuepress/public/ranking-rules/vogli3.png)

### Typo

- `vogli`: 0 typo
- `volli`: 1 typo

The `typo` rule sorts the results by increasing number of typos on matched query words.

</Tabs.Content>

<Tabs.Content label="Proximity">
![Demonstrating the proximity ranking rule by searching for 'new road'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/.vuepress/public/ranking-rules/new_road.png)

### Proximity

The reason why `Creature` is listed before `Mississippi Grind` is because of the `proximity` rule. The smallest **distance** between the matching words in `creature` is smaller than the smallest **distance** between the matching words in `Mississippi Grind`.

The `proximity` rule sorts the results by increasing distance between matched query terms.
</Tabs.Content>

<Tabs.Content label="Attribute">
![Demonstrating the attribute ranking rule by searching for 'belgium'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/.vuepress/public/ranking-rules/belgium.png)

### Attribute

`If It's Tuesday, This must be Belgium` is the first document because the matched word `Belgium` is found in the `title` attribute and not the `overview`.

The `attribute` rule sorts the results by [attribute importance](/learn/core_concepts/relevancy#attribute-ranking-order).

</Tabs.Content>

<Tabs.Content label="Exactness">
![Demonstrating the exactness ranking rule by searching for 'Knight'](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/blob/main/.vuepress/public/ranking-rules/knight.png?raw=true)

### Exactness

`Knight Moves` is displayed before `Knights of Badassdom`. `Knight` is exactly the same as the search query `Knight` whereas there is a letter of difference between `Knights` and the search query `Knight`.

</Tabs.Content>

</Tabs.Container>

### Custom rules

For now, Meilisearch supports two custom rules: one for ascending sort and one for descending sort.

To add a custom ranking rule, you have to communicate the attribute name followed by a colon (`:`) and either `asc` for ascending order or `desc` for descending order.

- To apply an **ascending sort** (results sorted by increasing value of the attribute): `attribute_name:asc`

- To apply a **descending sort** (results sorted by decreasing value of the attribute): `attribute_name:desc`

**The attribute must have either a numeric or a string value** in all of the documents contained in that index.

You can add this rule to the existing list of ranking rules using the [update settings endpoint](/reference/api/settings#update-settings) or [update ranking rules endpoint](/reference/api/settings#update-ranking-rules).

#### Example

Let's say you have a movie dataset. The documents contain the fields `release_date` with a timestamp as value, and `movie_ranking`, an integer that represents its ranking.

The following example will create a rule that makes older movies more relevant than recent ones. A movie released in 1999 will appear before a movie released in 2020.

```
release_date:asc
```

The following example will create a rule that makes movies with a good rank more relevant than movies with a lower rank. Movies with a higher ranking will appear first.

```
movie_ranking:desc
```

To add a rule to the existing ranking rule, you have to add the rule to the existing ordered rules array using the [settings route](/reference/api/settings#update-ranking-rules),

```json
[
  "words",
  "typo",
  "proximity",
  "attribute",
  "sort",
  "exactness",
  "release_date:asc",
  "movie_ranking:desc"
]
```

### Sorting and custom ranking rules

Meilisearch allows users to define [sorting order at query time](/learn/advanced/sorting) by using the [`sort` search parameter](/reference/api/search#sort). There is some overlap between sorting and custom ranking rules, but the two do have different uses.

In general, `sort` will be most useful when you want to allow users to define what type of results they want to see first. A good use-case for `sort` is creating a webshop interface where customers can sort products by descending or ascending product price.

Custom ranking rules, instead, are always active once configured and will be useful when you want to promote certain types of results. A good use-case for custom ranking rules is ensuring discounted products in a webshop always feature among the top results.

## Attribute ranking order

In a typical dataset, some fields are more relevant to search than others. A `title`, for example, has a value more meaningful to a movie search than its `overview` or its `release_date`.

By default, the attribute ranking order is generated automatically based on the order in which Meilisearch encounters attributes in the indexed documents. In other words, if your first indexed document looks like this:

```json
{
  "a": "some data",
  "b": "more data",
  "c": "other data"
}
```

The automatically generated attribute ranking order will be `["a", "b", "c"]`. If you then add a second document that looks like this:

```json
{
  "c": "other data",
  "d": "surprise data!",
  "a": "some data",
  "b": "more data"
}
```

The attribute ranking order will be updated to `["a", "b", "c", "d"]`. In other words, when Meilisearch encounters new attributes in subsequently indexed documents, they are added to the bottom of the attribute ranking order.

The attribute ranking order can also be set manually. For a more detailed look at this subject, see [the searchable attributes list](/learn/configuration/displayed_searchable_attributes#the-searchableattributes-list).

### Example

```json
[
  "title",
  "overview",
  "release_date"
]
```

With the above attribute ranking order, matching words found in the `title` field would have a higher impact on relevancy than the same words found in `overview` or `release_date`. If you searched "1984", for example, results like Michael Radford's film "1984" would be ranked higher than movies released in the year 1984.

<Capsule intent="note">
The `attribute` rule's position in [`rankingRules`](#built-in-rules) determines how the results are sorted. Meaning, **if `attribute` is at the bottom of the ranking rules list, it will have almost no impact on your search results.**
