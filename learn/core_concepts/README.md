# Core Concepts

This section defines the core concepts of MeiliSearch:
- [Documents](documents.md): Objects made up of key-value pairs.
- [Indexes](indexes.md): Entities that contain documents and search-related settings.
- [Relevancy](relevancy.md): Rules that help you get more intuitive results. The human element of your search engine.

::: tip Important
MeiliSearch is an **asynchronous** API. This means that, unlike a synchronous API, it doesn't wait for the call to be done as calls are placed in a queue for processing. For further information please read [the advanced guide](/guides/advanced_guides/asynchronous_updates.md).
