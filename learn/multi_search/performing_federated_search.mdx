# Using multi-search to perform a federated search

Meilisearch allows you to search in multiple indexes at the same time with the `/multi-search` endpoint. A federated search is a multi-index search that returns results across multiple indexes in a single list.

In this tutorial you will see how to create separate indexes containing different types of data from a CRM application. You will then perform a query searching all these indexes at the same time to obtain a single list of results.

## Requirements

- A running Meilisearch project
- A command-line console

## Create three indexes

Download the following datasets: <a href="/assets/datasets/crm-chats.json">`crm-chats.json`</a>, <a href="/assets/datasets/crm-profiles.json">`crm-profiles.json`</a>, and <a href="/assets/datasets/crm-tickets.json">`crm-tickets.json`</a> containing data from a fictional CRM application.

Add the datasets to Meilisearch and create three separate indexes, `profiles`, `chats`, and `tickets`:

```sh
curl  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/profiles'  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  --data-binary @crm-profiles.json &&
curl  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/chats'  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  --data-binary @crm-chats.json &&
curl  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/tickets'  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  --data-binary @crm-tickets.json
```

[Use the tasks endpoint](/learn/async/working_with_tasks) to check the indexing status. Once Meilisearch successfully indexed all three datasets, you are ready to perform a federated search.

## Perform a federated search

When you are looking for Natasha Nguyen's email address in your CRM application, you may not know whether you will find it in a chat log, among the existing customer profiles, or in a recent support ticket. In this situation, you can use federated search to search across all possible sources and receive a single list of results.

Use the `/multi-search` endpoint with the `federation` parameter to query the three indexes simultaneously:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/multi-search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "federation": {},
    "queries": [
      {
        "indexUid": "chats",
        "q": "natasha"
      },
      {
        "indexUid": "profiles",
        "q": "natasha"
      },
      {
        "indexUid": "tickets",
        "q": "natasha"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Meilisearch should respond with a single list of search results:

```json
{
  "hits": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "client_name": "Natasha Nguyen",
      "message": "My email is natasha.nguyen@example.com",
      "time": 1727349362,
      "_federation": {
        "indexUid": "chats",
        "queriesPosition": 0
      }
    },
    …
  ],
  "processingTimeMs": 0,
  "limit": 20,
  "offset": 0,
  "estimatedTotalHits": 3,
  "semanticHitCount": 0
}
```

## Promote results from a specific index

Since this is a CRM application, users have profiles with their preferred contact information. If you want to search for Riccardo Rotondo's preferred email, you can boost documents in the `profiles` index.

Use the `weight` property of the `federation` parameter to boost results coming from a specific index:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/multi-search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "federation": {},
    "queries": [
      {
        "indexUid": "chats",
        "q": "rotondo"
      },
      {
        "indexUid": "profiles",
        "q": "rotondo",
        "federationOptions": {
          "weight": 1.2 
        }
      },
      {
        "indexUid": "tickets",
        "q": "rotondo"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

This query will result in `profile` results ranking higher than documents in other indexes:

```json
{
  "hits": [
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Riccardo Rotondo",
    "email": "riccardo.rotondo@example.com",
      "_federation": {
        "indexUid": "profiles",
        "queriesPosition": 1
      }
    },
    …
  ],
  "processingTimeMs": 0,
  "limit": 20,
  "offset": 0,
  "estimatedTotalHits": 3,
  "semanticHitCount": 0
}
```

## Conclusion

You have created three indexes, then performed a federated multi-index search to receive all results in a single list. You then used `weight` to boost results from the index most likely to contain the information you wanted.
