# Documentation

This documentation website is hosted in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation). It is built with [VuePress](https://vuepress.github.io), written in [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

## Our Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation aims to be:

- **Efficient**. We don't want to waste anyone's time.
- **Simple**. Reading the documentation shouldn't require native English or an advanced degree.
- **Thorough**. Behavior that isn't documented or is documented incorrectly, we consider broken.
- **Open source**. This is a resource by MeiliSearch users, for MeiliSearch users. [We welcome outside contributions](#how-to-contribute).

## How to Contribute?

### Issues

On the MeiliSearch documentation team, [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues/new/choose) are the primary tool we use to track tasks. They're like elements in our to-do list. Here are some good uses for issues:

- A detailed bug report
- A request for a new technical feature (e.g. dark mode, versioning, etc.)
- A request for new content (e.g. a tutorial, guide, or explanation)
- A helpful suggestion for the future of the documentation

We love issues, because they help us do our jobs better. Nine times out of ten, the most useful contribution isn't a flashy [pull request](#pull-requests) that needs to be read and reviewed‚Äîit's a simple GitHub issue that points out a problem and proposes a solution.

#### Creating Your First Issue

All you need to create an issue is a [GitHub account](https://github.com).

1. Log into your account.
2. Go to the MeiliSearch [Documentation repository](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation).
3. Click on "Issues".
4. Click "New issue".
5. Fill in a short, descriptive title and longer summary of your problem or suggestion.
6. Click "Submit new issue".
7. Enjoy the feeling of a job well done! üéâ

### Pull Requests

Sometimes, the problem is so small or particular that it would be faster for you to fix it yourself than explain it to us. In those cases, rather than create an [issue](#issues), you should make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

Pull requests ("PRs" for short) are requests to integrate your changes into an official repository. The simplest way to create a PR on our documentation is by using the **"Edit this page"** link at the bottom left of every page. [See below](#creating-your-first-pr) for more detailed instructions.

Pull requests are particularly good for:

- Fixing a small error, such as a typo, broken link, or poor word choice.
- Making a change that you are especially qualified for (such as creating a guide for some software that you have mastered).
- **Solving an [existing issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/documentation/issues)**!

If the PR you're thinking about making isn't covered by the above list, it might be best to first [create an issue](#issues) to confirm that it's worth your time (and that nobody else is working on it already).

#### Creating Your First PR

There are many ways to create pull requests, but we'll cover the simplest method for this documentation site. Feel free to try it on this page!

All you need to continue is a [GitHub account](https://github.com).

1. On the documentation page you'd like to edit, scroll to the bottom and click **"Edit this page"** on the left. This will take you to GitHub.
2. If you're not already signed in, do so now. You may be prompted to create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)‚Äîif so, do it.
3. Use GitHub's text editor to make the change you want.
4. Scroll down to where it says `Propose changes`. In the first text box, write a short description (e.g. "Fix typo"). In the second text box, write a longer description of your changes if necessary.
5. Click `Propose changes` to continue. You should see a page that says `Comparing changes`. This screen is prompting you to create a pull request.
6. Make sure the base repository is `meilisearch/documentation` and the base is `master`. Don't worry about the other two boxes‚Äîthey automatically target the changes you just made.
7. Below, you can see the changes you made compared to the master branch (what's currently published on docs.meilisearch.com). When you're ready, click `Create pull request`.
8. **Congrats, you made your first PR!** Someone from the documentation team will review your pull request shortly. They may ask for changes, so keep an eye on your GitHub notifications.
9. If everything looks good, your work will be merged into the `master` branch and become part of the official documentation site. You are now a MeiliSearch Contributor! üöÄ

## How We Review Contributions

For **reviewing issues**, we consider a couple criteria:

1. Is this task a priority for the documentation team?
2. Is our documentation the best place for this information?
3. Is this the first time someone has asked for this?

If multiple people create similar issues (or upvote üëç an issue to show suport), that makes us more likely to divert resources towards that task.

For **reviewing contributor PRs**, we start by making sure the PR is up to our **quality standard**.

We ask the following questions:

1. Is the information **accurate**?
2. Is it **easy to understand**? Are explanations and examples clear?
3. Is the English **simple enough to be understood by a non-native speaker**?
4. Is the grammar perfect? Are there any typos?
5. Can it be **more efficient**?
6. Should any new information be added or changed somewhere else in the documentation?
7. In the case of new pages, has the page been added in the right location? Should it be linked elsewhere in the documentation?

Nothing makes us happier than getting a thoughtful, helpful PR that saves us time and effort and makes the documentation **even stronger**. Thank you in advance for your contribution!
