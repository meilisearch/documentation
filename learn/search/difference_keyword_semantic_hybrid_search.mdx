# When to use keyword, semantic, and hybrid search

Meilisearch offers three types of search: keyword, semantic, and hybrid. This article explains their differences and intended use cases.

## Keyword search

Keyword search is another name for traditional full-text search. When performing keyword searches, Meilisearch examines the indexed documents searching for acceptable matches to a set of search terms.

For example, when searching for `"pink sandals"`, keyword search will only return clothing items explicitly mentioning these two terms. Searching for `"summer shoes"` is likely to return less relevant results.

## Semantic search

Semantic search is part of Meilisearch's AI-powered search offerings. It integrates with LLM providers such as OpenAI and Hugging Face to generate document embeddings. Meilisearch then uses these embeddings to return search results based on a query's meaning and context.

For example, searching for `"cute pink summer shoes for girls"` will return light-coloured open shoes, including but not restricted to sandals.

Currently, semantic search will always return search results. In some cases, this may lead to results with very low relevancy.

## Hybrid search

Hybrid search performs keyword and semantic searches simultaneously, then returns both sets of results ordered by relevancy. It will return results quickly for precise queries, but will still deliver relevant results for other queries.

For example, searching for `"pink sandals"` will be more efficient, but queries for `"cute pink summer shoes for girls"` will still return relevant results.

## Use cases

Keyword search is a reliable choice that will work well in most scenarios. It is fast, requires fewer resources, and requires no extra configuration. It is best suited for situations where you need precise matches to a query and your users are familiar with relevant keywords.

Hybrid search combines the flexibility of semantic search with the performance of keyword search. In most cases it will offer your users the best search experience, but will require extra configuration and may entail extra costs.

Pure semantic search will offer a generally worse search experience than hybrid search. In the majority of cases, you should use hybrid search over pure semantic search.
