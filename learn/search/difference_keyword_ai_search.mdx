# Differences between keyword and AI-powered search

Meilisearch offers two types of search: keyword search and AI-powered search. This article explains their differences and intended use cases.

## Keyword search

Keyword search is another name for traditional full-text search. This is Meilisearch's default search type. When performing keyword searches, Meilisearch checks the indexed documents for acceptable matches to a set of search terms.

For example, when searching for `"pink sandals"`, keyword search will only return clothing items explicitly mentioning these two terms. Searching for `"pink summer shoes for girls"` is likely to return less relevant results.

## AI-powered search

AI-powered search uses LLM providers such as OpenAI and Hugging Face to generate document embeddings. When users search in your application, Meilisearch return results based both on keywords and the semantic context of the query.

By default, Meilisearch returns both keyword and semantic results. This is also called hybrid search. You may configure Meilisearch so it only returns semantic results. This is also called semantic search.

With AI-powered hybrid search, searching for `"pink sandals"` will be more efficient, but queries for `"cute pink summer shoes for girls"` will still return relevant results including light-coloured open shoes.

## Use cases

Keyword search is a reliable choice that will work well in most scenarios. It is fast, less resource-intensive, and requires no extra configuration. It is best suited for situations where you need precise matches to a query and your users are familiar with relevant keywords.

AI-powered search combines the flexibility of semantic search with the performance of keyword search. Most searches, whether short and precise or long and vague, will return very relevant search results. In most cases, AI-powered search will offer your users the best search experience, but will require extra configuration. AI-powered search may also entail extra costs if you use a third-party service such as OpenAI to generate document embeddings.
