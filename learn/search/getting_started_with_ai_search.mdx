# Getting started with AI-powered search

[AI-powered search](https://meilisearch.com/solutions/vector-search?utm_campaign=vector-search&utm_source=aipowered-tutorial), sometimes also called vector search, is an experimental technology that uses [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) to retrieve search results based on the meaning and context of a query.

This tutorial will walk you through configuring AI-powered search in your Meilisearch project. You will activate the vector store setting, generate document embeddings with OpenAI, and perform your first search.

## Requirements

- a running Meilisearch project
- an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- a command-line console

## Create a new index

Create a `kitchenware` index and add [this kitchenware products dataset](/assets/datasets/kitchenware.json) to it. If necessary, consult the quick start for instructions on how to configure a basic Meilisearch install.

## Activate AI-powered search

First, activate the AI-powered search experimental feature. Exactly how to do that depends on whether you are using [Meilisearch Cloud](#meilisearch-cloud-projects) or [self-hosting Meilisearch](#self-hosted-instances).

### Meilisearch Cloud projects

If using Meilisearch Cloud, navigate to your project overview and find "Experimental features". Then check the "AI-powered search" box.

![A section of the project overview interface titled "Experimental features". The image shows a few options, including "Vector store".](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/images/vector-search/01-cloud-vector-store.png)

<Capsule intent="note" title="Meilisearch Cloud AI-powered search waitlist">
To ensure proper scaling of Meilisearch Cloud's latest AI-powered search offering, you must enter the waitlist before activating vector search. You will not be able to activate vector search in the Cloud interface or via the `/experimental-features` route until your sign up has been approved.
</Capsule>

### Self-hosted instances

Use [the `/experimental-features` route](/reference/api/experimental_features) to activate vector search during runtime:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "vectorStore": true
  }'
```

## Generate vector embeddings with OpenAI

Next, you must generate vector embeddings for all documents in your dataset. Embeddings are mathematical representations of the meanings of words and sentences in your documents. Meilisearch relies on external providers to generate these embeddings. Use OpenAI for this tutorial.

Use the `embedders` index setting of the [update `/settings` endpoint](/reference/api/settings) to configure a default [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) embedder:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/kitchenware/settings' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "embedders": {
      "default": {
        "source":  "openAi",
        "apiKey": "OPEN_AI_API_KEY",
        "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
        "documentTemplate": "An object used in a kitchen named '{{doc.name}}'"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Replace `OPEN_AI_API_KEY` with your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). You may use any key tier for this tutorial, but prefer [Tier 2 keys](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers?context=tier-two) for optimal performance in production environments.

### `documentTemplate`

`documentTemplate` describes a short [Liquid template](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). The text inside curly brackets (`{{`) indicates a document field in dot notation, where `doc` indicates the document itself and the string that comes after the dot indicates a document attribute. Meilisearch replaces these brackets and their contents with the corresponding field value.

The resulting text is the prompt OpenAI uses to generate document embeddings.

For example, kitchenware documents have three fields: `id`, `name`, and `price`. If your `documentTemplate` is `"An object used in a kitchen named '{{doc.name}}'"`, the text Meilisearch will send to the embedder when indexing the first document is `"An object used in a kitchen named 'Wooden spoon'"`.

For the best results, always provide a `documentTemplate`. Keep your templates short and only include highly relevant information. This ensures the best indexing performance and search result relevancy.

## Perform an AI-powered search

Perform AI-powered searches with `q` and `hybrid` to retrieve search results using the default embedder you configured in the previous step:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/kitchenware/search' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{ 
    "q": "kitchen utensils made of wood",
    "hybrid": {
      "embedder": "default",
      "semanticRatio": 0.7
    }
  }'
```

Meilisearch will return a mix of semantic and keyword matches, prioritizing results that match the query's meaning and context. If you want Meilisearch to return more results based on the meaning and context of a search, set `semanticRatio` to a value greater than `0.5`. Setting `semanticRatio` to a value lower than `0.5`, instead, will return more keyword matches.

## Conclusion

You have seen how to setup and perform AI-powered searches with Meilisearch and OpenAI. For more in-depth information, consult the reference for embedders and the `hybrid` search parameter.

AI-powered is an experimental Meilisearch feature and is undergoing active development—[join the discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/discussions/677).
