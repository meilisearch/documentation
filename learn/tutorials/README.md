# Learn MeiliSearch Through Tutorials

MeiliSearch has been developed to provide an easily integrated search solution. Each step of the implementation process has been designed to be **as simple and intuitive as possible**. Still, a tutorial or two never hurt anyone!

The aim of these tutorials is **to provide a thorough introduction to all of MeiliSearch's core features** and prepare you to start your own MeiliSearch projects. It is **not** to provide exhaustive or universal instructions on how to use MeiliSearch's [SDKs](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/sdks.md) or [API](/reference/api).
