# Strapi v4 guide

This tutorial will show you how to integrate Meilisearch with [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) to create a search-based web app. We are going to use Strapi’s quick start guide to create a restaurant collection, and then use Meilisearch to search through our collection data.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): active LTS or maintenance LTS versions, currently Node.js >=18.0.0 \<=20.x.x
- npm >=6.0.0 (installed with Node.js) 
- A running instance of Meilisearch (v >= 1.x). If you need help with this part, you can consult the [Installation section](/learn/getting_started/installation). 

## Create a back-end using Strapi

Create a directory called `my-app` where you will add our back and front-end parts of the application. Generate a back-end API using Strapi inside `my-app`:

```bash
npx create-strapi-app@latest back --quickstart
```

This command creates a Strapi app in a new directory called `back` and opens the admin dashboard. Create an account to access it.

Once you have created your account, you should be redirected to Strapi's admin dashboard. This is where you will configure your back-end API.

The next step is to create a new collection type. A collection is like a blueprint of your content—in this case, it will be a collection of restaurants. You will create another collection called "Category" to organize your restaurants later.

To follow along, complete "Part B:  Build your data structure with the Content-type Builder" and steps 2 to 5 in "Part D: Add content to your Strapi Cloud project with the Content Manager" from Strapi's quick start guide. These will include:

- creating collection types
- creating new entries
- setting roles & permissions
- publishing the content

After finishing those steps of Strapi's quick start guide, two new collections named Restaurant and Category should have appeared under `Content Manager > Collection Types`. If you click on `Restaurant`, you can see that there is only one. Add more by clicking the `+ Create new entry` button in the upper-right corner of the dashboard.

Add the following three restaurants, one by one. For each restaurant, you need to press `Save` and then `Publish`.

- Name: `The Butter Biscotte` 
- Description: `All about butter, nothing about health.`

Next, add the `French food` category on the bottom right corner of the page.

[Strapi dashboard: create an entry form, arrow indicating the location of the categorie's location in the right side menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/images/strapi-v4/strapi-add-category.png)

- Name: `The Slimy Snail` 
- Description: `Gastronomy is made of garlic and butter.` 
- Category: `French food`

- Name: `The Smell of Blue` 
- Description: `Blue Cheese is not expired, it is how you eat it. With a bit of butter and a lot of happiness.` 
- Category: `French food`

Your Strapi back-end is now up and running. Strapi automatically creates a REST API for your Restaurants collection. Check Strapi's documentation for all available [API endpoints](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/content-api/content-api.html#api-endpoints).

Now, it’s time to connect Strapi and Meilisearch and start searching through our data.

## Connect Strapi and Meilisearch

In order to add the Meilisearch plugin to Strapi, you need to quit our Strapi app. Go to the terminal window running Strapi and push `Ctrl+C` to kill the process.

Next, install the plugin in the `back` directory.

```bash
npm install strapi-plugin-meilisearch
```

After the installation, you have to rebuild the Strapi app before starting it again in development mode, since it makes configuration easier.

```bash
npm run build
npm run develop
```

At this point, your Strapi app should be running once again on the default address: http://localhost:1337/admin/. Open it in your browser, you should see an admin log-in page; enter the credentials you used to create your account.

Once connected, you should see the new `meilisearch` plugin on the left side of the screen.

Add your Meilisearch credentialson the Settings tab of the `meilisearch` plugin page.

Now it's time to add your Strapi collection to Meilisearch. In the `Collections` tab on the `meilisearch` plugin page, you should see the `restaurant` and `category` content-types.

By clicking on the checkbox next to `restaurant`, the content-type is automatically indexed in Meilisearch.

The word “Hooked” appears when you click on the `restaurant`'s checkbox in the `Collections` tab. This means that each time you add, update or delete an entry in your restaurant content-types, Meilisearch is automatically updated.

Once the indexing finishes, your restaurants are in Meilisearch. Access the [search preview](/learn/getting_started/search_preview) confirm everything is working correctly by searching for “butter”.

Your Strapi entries are sent to Meilisearch as is. You can modify the data before sending it to Meilisearch, for instance by removing a field. Check out all the customization options on the [strapi-plugin-meilisearch page](https://github.com/meilisearch/strapi-plugin-meilisearch/#-customization).

## What's next

This tutorial taught you how to add your Strapi collections to Meilisearch. 

In most real-life scenarios, you'll typically build a custom search interface and fetch results using Meilisearch's API. To learn how to quickly build a front-end interface of your own, check out the [Front-end integration page](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/front_end/front_end_integration) guide.
