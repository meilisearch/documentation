# Migrating from a self-hosted Meilisearch install to Meilisearch Cloud

This guide walks you through migrating Meilisearch from a self-hosted installation to Meilisearch Cloud. Meilisearch Cloud is the officially recommended way of using Meilisearch. 

## Requirements

To follow this guide you need:

- A running Meilisearch instance
- A command-line terminal
- A Meilisearch Cloud account

## Export a dump

To migrate Meilisearch, you must first [export a dump](/learn/advanced/dumps). A dump is a compressed file containing all your indexes, documents, and settings.

To export a dump, make sure your self-hosted Meilisearch instance is running. Then, open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `MEILISEARCH_URL` with your instance's address:

```sh
curl  -X POST 'http://MEILISEARCH_URL:7700/dumps'
```

Meilisearch will return a summarized task object:

```json
{
  "taskUid": 1,
  "indexUid": null,
  "status": "enqueued",
  "type": "dumpCreation",
  "enqueuedAt": "2022-06-21T16:10:29.217688Z"
}
```

Depending on your dataset size, this operation might take a few moments. [Use the returned `taskUid` to monitor its progress.](/learn/async/asynchronous_operations)

Once the task is completed, you can find it in your project's dump directory. By default, this is `/dumps`.

<Capsule intent="note" title="Command-line options and environment variables">
Instance configuration options or experimental features that can only be activated at launch are not included in dumps. Additionally, not all instance options are supported in the Cloud.

Once you have successfully migrated your data to Meilisearch Cloud, use the project overview interface to reactivate available options.

## Create a Meilisearch Cloud project and import dump

Navigate to Meilisearch Cloud in your browser and log in. If you don't have a Meilisearch Cloud account yet, you can create one for free.

You can only import dumps into new Meilisearch Cloud projects. Create a new project by clicking on the "New project" button:

![The Meilisearch Cloud menu, featuring the "New Project" button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/images/cloud-getting-started/1-new-project.png)

This will launch the project creation interface. Fill in your project name, choose a server location, and select your plan. Then, click on the "Import .dump" button and select the dump file you generated in the previous step:

Meilisearch will start creating a new project and importing your data into it. This might take a few moments depending on the size of your dataset. Monitor the project creation status in the  project overview page.

<Capsule intent="danger" title="Master key and API keys">
Meilisearch Cloud automatically generates a new master key during migration. If you were using security keys before the migration, so you need to update your application so it uses the new Meilisearch Cloud API keys.

## Search preview

Once your project is ready, click on its URL. This will bring you to the search preview interface, where you can type a few searches and ensure all data was migrated successfully.

Congratulations, you have now migrated to Meilisearch Cloud, the officially recommended way to use Meilisearch.
