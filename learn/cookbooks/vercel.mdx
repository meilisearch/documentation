# Integrate Meilisearch Cloud with Vercel

Getting a Meilisearch Cloud instance created and linked to your Vercel projects has never been easier. 

## Introducing our tools

### What is Vercel?

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform for building and deploying web applications. It works out of the box with most popular web development tools.

### What is Meilisearch Cloud?

[Meilisearch Cloud](https://www.meilisearch.com/cloud) is a cloud-based SaaS platform, built on top of the Meilisearch open-source search engine.

## Create a Vercel project and integrate Meilisearch

From your Vercel dashboard, create a new project. You can create a project from a template, or import a Git repository.

![Create a new project on Vercel dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/images/vercel/01.create-new-project-on-vercel-dashboard.png)

Select your project, then click on **Deploy**. Once deployment is complete, go back to your project’s dashboard. 

Go to the project settings tab and click on **Integrations** on the sidebar menu to the left of your screen.

Search for the [Meilisearch Cloud integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/meilisearch) in the search bar. Click on the **Add integration** button.

Select the Vercel account or team and the project you to which you want to add the integration. You may add the Meilisearch Cloud integration to one or more projects in this menu.

![Form to add Meilisearch Cloud integration, the "Specific projects" option is selected](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/images/vercel/04.add-meilisearch-cloud-form.png)

Click on **Continue**. Vercel will display a list with the permissions the integration needs to work properly. Review it, then click on **Add Integration**.

Vercel will redirect you to the Meilisearch Cloud page. Log in or create an account. New accounts enjoy a 14-day free trial period.

You can choose an existing project or create a new one. To create a new project, complete the form with the project name and region.

Once you click on **Create project**, you should see the following message:
“Your Meilisearch + Vercel integration is one click away from being completed.” and a button to finish the setup. On clicking the button, it should redirect you to the integration page in your Vercel Dashboard.

Meilisearch creates two default API keys: [`Default Search API Key` and `Default Admin API Key`](/learn/security/master_api_keys#using-default-api-keys-for-authorization). 

Use the `Default Admin API Key`, to control who can access or create new documents, indexes, and change index settings. Be careful with the admin key and avoid exposing it in public environments.

Use the `Default Search API Key` to access the [search route](/reference/api/search). This is the one you want to use in your front end.

Both keys are automatically added to Vercel along with the Meilisearch host or URL.

Go back to your project settings and check the new Meilisearch environment variables:
- `MEILISEARCH_ADMIN_KEY`
- `MEILISEARCH_URL`
- `MEILISEARCH_SEARCH_KEY`

![Display the environment variables in the project settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/images/vercel/07.project-settings-environment-variables-tab.png)

The master key–which hasn’t been added to Vercel–grants users full control over an instance, you can find it in your project’s overview on your [Meilisearch Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.meilisearch.com/projects/).
