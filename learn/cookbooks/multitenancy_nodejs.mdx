# How to implement multitenancy with Node.js

## What is multitenancy?

In software development, multitenancy means that multiple users — also called tenants — share the same computing resources but have different access to system-wide data.

In Meilisearch, you might have one index containing data belonging to many distinct tenants. In such cases, your tenants must only be able to search through their own documents. You can implement this using [tenant tokens](/learn/security/tenant_tokens).

## Requirements

For this guide, you will need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (we recommend the latest LTS version)
- A package manager like `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`
- [Meilisearch JavaScript SDK](/learn/what_is_meilisearch/sdks)

## Creating a tenant token

The example below uses the `generateTenantToken` function to create a tenant token that will be used to search through documents belonging to a given organization.

```js
import { Meilisearch } from 'meilisearch'

const apiKey = '<YOUR_SEARCH_API_KEY>';
const apiKeyUid = '<YOUR_SEARCH_API_KEY_UID>';

const client = new Meilisearch({
	host: 'https://edge.meilisearch.com', // Your Meilisearch host
	apiKey: apiKey
})


// These rules gives access only to documents that belong to a given organization
const organizationId = 1 // Retrieve the organizationId from your database, etc.
const searchRules = {
	'*': {
		'filter': `organization_id = ${organizationId}`
	}
}

const tenantToken = client.generateTenantToken(
  apiKeyUid,
  searchRules,
  {
    expiresAt: new Date('2025-01-01'), // Choose an expiration date
    apiKey: apiKey,
  }
)
```

When Meilisearch gets a search query with a tenant token, it decodes it and applies the search rules to the search request. In this example, the results are filtered by the `organization_id` field, thus preventing access to documents that do not belong to the organization.

Use this tenant token to perform searches against your Meilisearch instance. Like all search API keys, you can safely share it in your front-end applications.
