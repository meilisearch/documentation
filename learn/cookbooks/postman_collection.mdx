# Postman collection for Meilisearch

Are you tired of using the `curl` command in your terminal to test Meilisearch? It can be tedious to re-write every route when wanting to try out an API.

Postman is a platform that lets you create HTTP requests you can easily reuse and share with everyone. We provide a <a href="/assets/misc/meilisearch-collection-postman.json" download="meilisearch-collection-postman.json">Postman collection</a> containing all the routes of the Meilisearch API! ðŸš€

If you don't have Postman already, you can [download it here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). It's free and available on many OS distributions.

## Import the collection

Once you have downloaded the [Postman collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/misc/meilisearch-collection-postman.json), you need to import it into Postman.

## Edit the configuration

![Selecting "Edit" from the overflow menu](/assets/images/postman/edit.png)

Set the "Token" if needed (set to `masterKey` by default):

![The "Token" field set to masterKey and "Type" to Bearer Token in the "Authorization" tab.](/assets/images/postman/set_token.png)

Set `url` (set to Meilisearch's local port by default) and `indexUID` (set to `indexUID` by default):

![Setting the "URL" to http://localhost:7700/ and "indexUID" to indexUId in the Variables tab.](/assets/images/postman/set_variables.png)

The `url` and `indexUID` variables are used in all the collection routes, like in this one:

## Start to use it!

You can now [run your Meilisearch instance](/learn/getting_started/quick_start#setup-and-installation) and create your first index:
