This guide for experienced users shows you how to compile a Meilisearch binary that generates Hugging Face embeddings with an Nvidia GPU.

## Prerequisites

- A [CUDA-compatible Linux distribution](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#id12)
- Nvidia GPU with CUDA support
- A modern Rust compiler

## Install CUDA

Follow Nvidia's [CUDA installation instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html).

## Verify your CUDA install

After you have installed CUDA in your machine, run the following command in your command-line terminal:

```sh
nvcc --version | head -1
```

If CUDA is working correctly, you will see the following response:

```
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
```

## Compile Meilisearch

First, clone Meilisearch:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch.git
```

Then, compile the Meilisearch binary with `cuda`:

```sh
cargo build --release --features cuda
```

This might take a few moments. Once the compiler is done, you should have a CUDA-compatible Meilisearch binary.

## Enable vector search

Run your freshly compiled Meilisearch, enabling the vector store experimental feature:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{ "vectorStore": true }'
```

Then, add the Hugging Face embedder to your index settings:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/INDEX_NAME/settings/embedders' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary \
  '{ "default": { "source": "huggingFace" } }'
```

Meilisearch will return a summarized task object and put your request on the task queue. The Hugging Face embedder will be ready to use once the task is completed.

## Conclusion

You have seen how to compile a Meilisearch binary that uses your Nvidia GPU to compute vector embeddings. Doing this should significantly speed up indexing when using Hugging Face. On an AWS Graviton 2 machine, enabling CUDA may reduce indexing time by over than 300%.
