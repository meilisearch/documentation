# Cookbooks

Each guide in this section takes the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem. Like recipes in a cookbook, they are **repeatable solutions** you can return to many times.

This is not the best section for MeiliSearch beginners. If you'd like to follow a step-by-step guide that introduces you to the basics of MeiliSearch, check out our [quick start guide](/learn/getting_started/quick_start.md).
