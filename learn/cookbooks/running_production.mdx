# Running a self-hosted Meilisearch project in production

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a production-ready Debian server in a DigitalOcean droplet. It covers installing Meilisearch and setting up a secure environment.

<Capsule intent="note">
[Meilisearch Cloud](https://www.meilisearch.com/cloud?utm_campaign=oss&utm_source=docs&utm_medium=running-production-oss) is the recommended way to run Meilisearch in production environments.
</Capsule>

## Requirements

- A DigitalOcean droplet running Debian 10
- An SSH key pair to connect to that machine

<Capsule intent="tip">
DigitalOcean has extensive documentation on [how to use SSH to connect to a droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/).
</Capsule>

## Step 1: Install Meilisearch

Log into your server via SSH, update the list of available packages, and install `curl`:

```sh
apt update
apt install curl -y
```

Using the latest version of a package is good security practice, especially in production environments.

Next, use `curl` to download and run the Meilisearch command-line installer:

```sh
# Install Meilisearch latest version from the script
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh
```

The Meilisearch installer is a set of scripts that ensure you will get the correct binary for your system.

Give the binary the required execute permission:

```sh
chmod +x meilisearch
```

The last step is to make the binary accessible from anywhere in your system. Move the binary file into `/usr/local/bin`:

```sh
mv ./meilisearch /usr/local/bin/
```

Meilisearch is now ready to use. 

## Step 2: Create system user

Running applications as root exposes you to unnecessary security risks. To prevent that, create a dedicated user for Meilisearch:

```sh
useradd -d /var/lib/meilisearch -b /bin/false -m -r meilisearch
```

## Step 3: Create a configuration file

After installing Meilisearch and taking the first step towards keeping your data safe, you need to set up a basic configuration file.

First, create the directories where Meilisearch will store its data:

```bash
mkdir /var/lib/meilisearch/data /var/lib/meilisearch/dumps /var/lib/meilisearch/snapshots
chown -R meilisearch:meilisearch /var/lib/meilisearch
chmod 750 /var/lib/meilisearch
```

Next, download the default configuration to `/etc`:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/latest/config.toml > /etc/meilisearch.toml
```

Finally, update the following lines in the `meilisearch.toml` file so Meilisearch uses the directories you created earlier to store its data, replacing `MASTER_KEY` with a 16-byte string:

```ini
env = "production"
master_key = "MASTER_KEY"
db_path = "/var/lib/meilisearch/data"
dump_dir = "/var/lib/meilisearch/dumps"
snapshot_dir = "/var/lib/meilisearch/snapshots"
```

Remember to choose a safe master key and avoid exposing it in publicly accessible locations.

You have now configured your Meilisearch instance.

## Step 4: Run Meilisearch as a service

In Linux environments, a service is a process that can be launched when the operating system is booting and which will keep running in the background. If your program stops running for any reason, Linux will immediately restart the service, helping reduce downtime.

### 4.1. Create a service file

Service files are text files that tell your operating system how to run your program. 

Run this command to create a service file in `/etc/systemd/system`:

```bash
cat << EOF > /etc/systemd/system/meilisearch.service
[Unit]
Description=Meilisearch
After=systemd-user-sessions.service

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/meilisearch
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/meilisearch --config-file-path /etc/meilisearch.toml
User=meilisearch
Group=meilisearch

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

### 4.2. Enable and start service

With your service file now ready to go, activate the service using `systemctl`:

```bash
systemctl enable meilisearch
systemctl start meilisearch
```

With `systemctl enable`, you're telling the operating system you want it to run at every boot. `systemctl start` then immediately starts the Meilisearch service.

Ensure everything is working by checking the service status:

```sh
systemctl status meilisearch
```

You should see a message confirming your service is running: 

```sh
● meilisearch.service - Meilisearch
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/meilisearch.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Fri 2023-04-10 14:27:49 UTC; 1min 8s ago
 Main PID: 14960 (meilisearch)
```

## Step 5: Secure and finish your setup

At this point, Meilisearch is installed and running. It is also protected from eventual crashes and system restarts.

The next step is to make your instance publicly accessible. 

<Capsule intent="tip">
If all the requests you send to Meilisearch are done by another application living in the same machine, you can safely skip this section.
</Capsule>

### 5.1. Creating a reverse proxy with Nginx

A [reverse proxy](https://www.keycdn.com/support/nginx-reverse-proxy) is an application that will handle every communication between the outside world and your application. In this tutorial, you will use [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as your reverse proxy to receive external HTTP requests and redirect them to Meilisearch. 

First, install Nginx on your machine:

```bash
apt-get install nginx -y
```

Next, delete the default configuration file:

```bash
rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Nginx comes with a set of default settings, such as its default HTTP port, that might conflict with Meilisearch.

Create a new configuration file specifying the reverse proxy settings:

```sh
cat << EOF > /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/meilisearch
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;
    server_name _;
    location / {
        proxy_pass  http://localhost:7700;
    }
}
EOF
```

Finally, enable the Nginx service:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable nginx
systemctl restart nginx
```

Your Meilisearch instance is now publicly available.

### 5.2. Enable HTTPS

The only remaining problem is that Meilisearch processes requests via HTTP without any additional security. This is a major security flaw that could result in an attacker accessing your data.

This tutorial assumes you have a registered domain name, and you have correctly configured its DNS's `A record` to point to your DigitalOcean droplet's IP address. Consult the [DigitalOcean DNS documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/networking/dns/getting-started/dns-registrars/) for more information.

Use [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to configure enable HTTPS in your server.

First, install the required packages on your system:

```bash
sudo apt-get install certbot python-certbot-nginx -y
```

Next, run certbot:

```bash
certbot --nginx
```

Enter your email address, agree to the Terms and Conditions, and choose your domain. When prompted if you want to automatically redirect HTTP traffic, choose option `2: Redirect`.

Certbot will finish configuring Nginx. Once it is done, all traffic to your server will use HTTPS and you will have finished securing your Meilisearch instance.

## Conclusion

You have followed the main steps to provide a safe and stable service. Your Meilisearch instance is now up and running in a safe and publicly accessible environment thanks to the combination of a reverse proxy, HTTPS, and Meilisearch's built-in security keys.
