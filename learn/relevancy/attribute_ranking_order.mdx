# Attribute ranking order

In most datasets, some fields are more relevant to search than others. A `title`, for example, might be more meaningful to a movie search than its `overview` or its `release_date`.

When `searchableAttributes` is using its default value, `[*]`, all fields carry the same weight.

If you manually configure [the searchable attributes list](/learn/relevancy/displayed_searchable_attributes#the-searchableattributes-list), attributes that appear early in the array are more important when claculating search result relevancy.

## Example

```json
[
  "title",
  "overview",
  "release_date"
]
```

With the above attribute ranking order, matching words found in the `title` field would have a higher impact on relevancy than the same words found in `overview` or `release_date`. If you searched for "1984", for example, results like Michael Radford's film "1984" would be ranked higher than movies released in the year 1984.

## Attribute ranking order and nested objects

By default, nested fields share the same weight as their parent attribute. Use dot notation to set different weights for attributes in nested objects:

```json
[
  "title", 
  "review.critic", 
  "overview", 
  "review.user"
]
```

With the above ranking order, `review.critic` becomes more important than its sibling `review.user` when calculating a document's ranking score.

<Capsule intent="note">
The `attribute` rule's position in [`rankingRules`](#built-in-rules) determines how the results are sorted. Meaning, **if `attribute` is at the bottom of the ranking rules list, it will have almost no impact on your search results.**
