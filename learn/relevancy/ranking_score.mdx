# Ranking score

When using the [`showRankingScore` search parameter](/reference/api/search#ranking-score), Meilisearch adds a global ranking score field, `_rankingScore`, to each document. The `_rankingScore` is between `0.0` and `1.0`. The higher the ranking score, the more relevant the document.

Ranking rules sort documents either by relevancy (`words`, `typo`, `proximity`, `exactness`, `attribute`) or by the value of a field (`sort`). Since `sort`  doesn't rank documents by relevancy, it does not influence the `_rankingScore`.

<Capsule intent="note">
A document's ranking score does not change based on the scores of other documents in the same index.

For example, if a document A has a score of `0.5` for a query term, this value remains constant no matter the score of documents B, C, or D.

The table below details all the index settings that can influence the `_rankingScore`. **Unlisted settings do not influence the ranking score.**
