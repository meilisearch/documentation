description: This article explains how the order of attributes in the `searchableAttributes` array impacts search result relevancy.
---

When using the [`showRankingScore` search parameter](/reference/api/search#ranking-score), Meilisearch adds a global ranking score field, `_rankingScore`, to each document. The `_rankingScore` is between `0.0` and `1.0`. The higher the ranking score, the more relevant the document.

Ranking rules sort documents either by relevancy (`words`, `typo`, `proximity`, `exactness`, `attributeRank`, `attributePosition`) or by the value of a field (`sort`). Since `sort`  doesn't rank documents by relevancy, it does not influence the `_rankingScore`.

<Note>
A document's ranking score does not change based on the scores of other documents in the same index.

For example, if a document A has a score of `0.5` for a query term, this value remains constant no matter the score of documents B, C, or D.
</Note>

The table below details all the index settings that can influence the `_rankingScore`. **Unlisted settings do not influence the ranking score.**

| Index setting          | Influences if                                        | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `searchableAttributes` | The `attributeRank` ranking rule is used             | The `attributeRank` ranking rule rates the document depending on the attribute in which the query terms show up. The order is determined by `searchableAttributes`          |
| `searchableAttributes` | The `attributePosition` ranking rule is used         | The `attributePosition` ranking rule rates the document based on the position of query terms within attributes                                                               |
