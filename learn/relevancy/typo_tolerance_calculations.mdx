# Typo tolerance calculations

Typo tolerance helps users find relevant results even when their search queries contain spelling mistakes or typos, for example, typing `phnoe` instead of `phone`. You can [configure the typo tolerance feature for each index](/reference/api/settings#update-typo-tolerance-settings).

Meilisearch uses a prefix [Levenshtein algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) to determine if a word in a document could be a possible match for a query term.

The [number of typos referenced above](#minwordsizefortypos) is roughly equivalent to Levenshtein distance. The Levenshtein distance between two words _M_ and _P_ can be thought of as "the minimum cost of transforming _M_ into _P_" by performing the following elementary operations on _M_:

- substitution of a character (for example, `kitten` → `sitten`)
- insertion of a character (for example, `siting` → `sitting`)
- deletion of a character (for example, `saturday` → `satuday`)

By default, Meilisearch uses the following rules for matching documents. Note that these rules are **by word** and not for the whole query string.

- If the query word is between `1` and `4` characters, **no typo** is allowed. Only documents that contain words that **start with** or are of the **same length** with this query word are considered valid
- If the query word is between `5` and `8` characters, **one typo** is allowed. Documents that contain words that match with **one typo** are retained for the next steps.
- If the query word contains more than `8` characters, we accept a maximum of **two typos**

This means that `saturday` which is `7` characters long, uses the second rule and matches every document containing **one typo**. For example:

- `saturday` is accepted because it is the same word
- `satuday` is accepted because it contains **one typo**
- `sutuday` is not accepted because it contains **two typos**
- `caturday` is not accepted because it contains **two typos** (as explained [above](#minwordsizefortypos), a typo on the first letter of a word is treated as two typos)

## Impact of typo tolerance on the `typo` ranking rule

The [`typo` ranking rule](/learn/relevancy/ranking_rules#2-typo) sorts search results by increasing number of typos on matched query words. Documents with 0 typos will rank highest, followed by those with 1 and then 2 typos.

The presence or absence of the `typo` ranking rule has no impact on the typo tolerance setting. However, **[disabling the typo tolerance setting](#configuring-typo-tolerance) effectively also disables the `typo` ranking rule.** This is because all returned documents will contain `0` typos.

To summarize:

- Typo tolerance affects how lenient Meilisearch is when matching documents
- The `typo` ranking rule affects how Meilisearch sorts its results
- Disabling typo tolerance also disables `typo`
