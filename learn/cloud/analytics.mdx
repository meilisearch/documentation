# Analytics

When working with Meilisearch, it can be helpful to understand how users search in your application. Enable Meilisearch Cloud analytics to gain insight on what your users are searching for, how often they find it, and how much they have to wait between typing a query and receiving results.

## Requirements

The functionality described here is only available to Meilisearch Cloud users. If you are interested in search analytics for your application, create an account on Meilisearch Cloud.

## Activating analytics

### Enable analytics in the project overview

Log into your Meilisearch Cloud and navigate to your project's overview. Find the "Analytics" section and press the "Enable analytics" button:

![The analytics section of the project overview. It shows one button, "Enable analytics", and a short explanation of the feature.](test)

Meilisearch Cloud will process your request for a moment. The "Analytics" will update once this is done.

### Update URLs in your application

Enabling analytics generates a new URL for your project. Meilisearch Cloud is only able to monitor metrics for queries sent to this URL. 

Update your application so all API requests point to the new URL:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST 'http://edge.meilisearch.com/indexes/products/search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{ "q": "green socks" }'
```

Your old project URL will remain functional indefinitely. API calls using the old URL will not be reflected in the analytics interface.

To capture and process search analytics data, Meilisearch Cloud must route API requests through a proxy. This might slightly increase latency in some scenarios.
</Capsule>

### Configuring "clickthrough rate" and "average click position"

To track "clickthrough rate" and "average click position", Meilisearch Cloud needs to know when users click on search results.

Every time a user clicks on a search result, your application must contact Meilisearch Cloud with a `click` event object:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST 'http://edge.meilisearch.com' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer Meilisearch_API_Key'
  --data-binary '{ 
    eventType: "click",
    eventName: "search result click",
    indexUid: "products"
    objectID: 0,
    position: 0,
  }'
```

#### The `click` event object

The `click` event object must have the following fields:

```js
{
  'eventType': 'click',
  'eventName': 'search result click',
  'indexUid': 'products'
  'objectID': 0,
  'position': 0,
}
```

- `eventType`: indicates this is a `click` event
- `eventName`: an arbitrary string describing the event
- `indexUid`: the clicked document's index
- `objectID`: the clicked document's primary key
- `position`: the clicked document's position in the list of search results

### Configuring "conversion rate"

Conversion rate indicates the number of times a user takes action beyond clicking on a search result. Exactly what counts as a conversion depends on your specific application. For example, a web shop might count adding a product to their shopping cart as a conversion.

To track "conversion rate", first identify what should count as a conversion for your application. Then query your project URL with a `conversion` event object:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST 'http://edge.meilisearch.com' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer Meilisearch_API_Key'
  --data-binary '{ 
    eventType: 'conversion',
    eventName: 'product added to cart',
    indexUid: 'products'
    objectID: 0,
    position: 0
  }'
```

- `eventType`: indicates this is a `click` event
- `eventName`: an arbitrary string describing the event
- `indexUid`: the clicked document's index
- `objectID`: the clicked document's primary key
- `position`: the clicked document's position in the list of search results

#### The `conversion` event object

The `conversion` event object must have the following fields:

```js
{
  'eventType': 'conversion',
  'eventName': 'product added to cart',
  'indexUid': 'products'
  'objectID': 0,
  'position': 0
}
```

- `eventType`: indicates this is a `conversion` event
- `eventName`: an arbitrary string describing the event
- `indexUid`: the document's index
- `objectID`: the document's primary key
- `position`: the document's position in the list of search results

## Understanding the analytics interface

### Total users and user IDs

Indicates the total number of user IDs. IDs can be explicitly set with the `X-MS-USER-ID` HTTP header. If `X-MS-USER-ID` is not present, user IDs are generated based on `User-Agent` and `CF-Connecting-IP`.

### Total searches and search IDs

The total number of generated search IDs. Meilisearch Cloud generates a new search ID for each [user](#total-users) after 3 seconds of user inactivity. Multiple queries may be associated with a single search ID.

### Most searched queries 

Indicates the most common search terms in the specified time period. Meilisearch Cloud calculates this based on search IDs. If multiple queries correspond to the same search ID, Meilisearch Cloud only considers the terms present in the last query associated with that search ID.

### Searches with no results and no result rate

"Searches with no results" indicates search terms that did not return any results. If multiple queries correspond to the same search ID, Meilisearch Cloud only considers the terms present in the last query associated with that search ID.

The "No result rate" is the number of searches with no results divided by the total number of searches.

### Conversion rate

A conversion is when users take action beyond clicking on a search result. Exactly what counts as a conversion depends on your specific application. For example, a web shop might count adding a product to their shopping cart as a conversion.

"Conversion rate" indicates the number of searches that resulted in a `conversion` event divided by the number of total searches.

To track "conversion rates", configure your application to send `conversion` events to Meilisearch Cloud.

### Click-through rate and average click position

"Click-through rate" is the number of times users have clicked on a search result divided by the total number of searches.

"Average click position" indicates the average position of the search results users clicked on, with 0 indicating the first search result. 

In both metrics, lower values indicate searches are returning relevant results.

To track "click-through rate" and "average click position" configure, your application to send `click` events to Meilisearch Cloud. 

### Search requests

Indicates the total amount of queries targeting the `/search` route. This count is not dependent on search IDs and includes all queries.

### Search latency

The amount of time between a user submitting a search request and receiving search results in return. Lower numbers result in better search experience. 

### Countries with most searches

The number of searches per country, sorted by the number of searches.

## Deactivating analytics

### Disable analytics in the project overview

Log into your Meilisearch Cloud and navigate to your project's overview. Find the "Analytics" section and press the "Disable analytics" button:

![The analytics section of the project overview. It shows one button, "Enable analytics", and a short explanation of the feature.](test)

### Update URLs in your application

Disabling analytics changes your project URL to its previous value. Update your application so all API requests point to the correct URL:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST 'http://edge.meilisearch.com/indexes/products/search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{ "q": "green socks" }'
```

### Update `conversion` and `click` events

If you are no longer using Meilisearch Cloud analytics, update your application so it is no longer sending `conversion` and `click` events to Meilisearch Cloud.
