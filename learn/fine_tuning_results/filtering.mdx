# Filtering

Filters have several use-cases, such as refining search results and creating faceted search interfaces. Faceted search interfaces are particularly efficient in helping users navigate a great number of results across many broad categories.

## Configuring filters

Suppose you have a collection of movies called `movie_ratings` containing the following fields:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 458723,
    "title": "Us",
    "director": "Jordan Peele",
    "genres": [
      "Thriller",
      "Horror",
      "Mystery"
    ],
    "rating": {
      "critics": 86,
      "users": 73
    },
    "overview": "Husband and wife Gabe and Adelaide Wilson take their…"
  },
  …
]
```

If you want to filter results based on the `director` and `genres` attributes, you must first add them to the `filterableAttributes` list:

<CodeSamples id="filtering_update_settings_1" />

**This step is mandatory and cannot be done at search time**. Updating `filterableAttributes` requires Meilisearch to re-configure your index, which will take an amount of time proportionate to your dataset size and complexity.

<Capsule intent="note">
By default, `filterableAttributes` is empty. Filters do not work without first explicitly adding attributes to the `filterableAttributes` list.
</Capsule>

### Filters and data types

Filters work with numeric and string values. Empty fields or fields containing an empty array will be ignored.

Filters do not work with [`NaN`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN) and infinite values such as `inf` and `-inf` as they are [not supported by JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types). It is possible to filter infinite and `NaN` values if you parse them as strings, except when handling [`_geo` fields](/learn/fine_tuning_results/geosearch#preparing-documents-for-location-based-search).

We recommend homogeneous typing across fields, especially when dealing with large numbers. This is because Meilisearch does not enforce a specific schema when indexing data, the filtering engine will try to coerce the type of `value`. This can lead to undefined behavior when big floats are coerced into integers and reciprocally.

## Filter basics

Once you have designated certain attributes as `filterableAttributes`, you can use [the `filter` search parameter](/reference/api/search#filter) to filter your search according to those attributes. The `filter` search parameter refines search results by selecting documents matching the given filter and running the search query only on those documents.

`filter` expects a **filter expression** containing one or more **conditions**. A filter expression can be written as a string, array, or mix of both.

### Conditions

Conditions are a filter's basic building blocks. They are written in the `attribute OPERATOR value` format, where:

- `attribute` is the attribute of the field you want to filter on
- `OPERATOR` can be `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `TO`, `EXISTS`, `IN`, `NOT`, `AND`, or `OR`
- `value` is the value the `OPERATOR` should look for in the `attribute`

#### Examples

A basic condition could request movies containing the `horror` genre:

```
genres = horror
```

String values containing whitespace must be enclosed in single or double quotes:

```
director = 'Jordan Peele'
director = "Tim Burton"
```

Another condition could request movies released after 18 March 1995 (written as `795484800` in UNIX Epoch time):

```
release_date > 795484800
```

### Filter operators

#### Equality

The equality operator (`=`) returns all documents containing a specific value for a given attribute. When operating on strings, `=` is case-insensitive.

The following expression returns all action movies:

```
genres = action
```

<Capsule intent="note">
The equality operator does not return any results for `null` and empty arrays.
</Capsule>

#### Inequality

The inequality operator (`!=`) returns all documents not selected by the equality operator. When operating on strings, `!=` is case-insensitive.

The following expression returns all movies without the `action` genre:

```
genres != action
```

#### Comparison

The comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `TO`) select documents satisfying a comparison. Comparison operators only apply only to numerical values.

The expression below returns all documents with a user rating above 85:

```
rating.users > 85
```

To filter documents with a user rating of 80 or above but below 90, you would use:

```
rating.users >= 80 AND rating.users < 90
```

#### `TO`

`TO` is equivalent to `>= AND <=`. The following expression returns all movies with a user rating of 80 or above but below 90:

```
rating.users 80 TO 89
```

#### `EXISTS`

The `EXISTS` operator checks for the existence of a field. Fields with empty or `null` values count as existing.

The following expression returns all documents that contain the `release_date` field, even if it is empty or `null`:

```
release_date EXISTS
```

The negated form of the above expression can be written as:

```
release_date NOT EXISTS
NOT release_date EXISTS
```

Both forms are equivalent.

#### `IS EMPTY`

The `IS EMPTY` operator selects documents in which the specified attribute exists but contains empty values. The following expression only returns documents with an empty `overview` field:

```
overview IS EMPTY
```

`IS EMPTY` matches the following JSON values:

- `""`
- `[]`
- `{}`

Meilisearch does not treat `null` values as empty. To match `null` fields, use the [`IS NULL`](#is-null) operator.

Use `NOT` to build the negated form of `IS EMPTY`. This returns documents in which the specified attribute either does not exist or does not contain empty values:

```
overview IS NOT EMPTY
NOT overview IS EMPTY
```

Both forms are equivalent.

#### `IS NULL`

The `IS NULL` operator selects documents in which the specified attribute exists but contains a `null` value. The following expression only returns documents with a `null` `overview` field:

```
overview IS NULL
```

Use `NOT` to build the negated form of `IS NULL`. This returns documents in which the specified attribute is either not `null` or does not contain empty values:

```
overview IS NOT NULL
NOT overview IS NULL
```

Both forms are equivalent.

#### `IN`

`IN` combines equality operators by taking an array of comma-separated values delimited by square brackets. It selects all documents whose chosen field contains at least one of the specified values.

Both of the following expressions are equivalent and return all documents whose `genres` includes either `horror`, `comedy`, or both:

```
genres IN [horror, comedy]
genres = horror OR genres = comedy
```

The negated form of the above expression can be written as:

```
genres NOT IN [horror, comedy]
NOT genres IN [horror, comedy]
```

Both are equivalent and mean:

```
genres != horror AND genres != comedy
```

#### `NOT`

The negation operator (`NOT`) selects all documents that do not satisfy a condition. It has higher precedence than `AND` and `OR`.

The following expression will return all documents whose `genres` does not contain `horror` and documents with a missing `genres` field:

```
NOT genres = horror
```

### Filter expressions

You can build filter expressions by grouping basic conditions using `AND` and `OR`. Filter expressions can be written as strings, arrays, or a mix of both.

#### `AND`

`AND` connects two conditions and only returns documents that satisfy both of them. `AND` has higher precedence than `OR`.

The following expression returns all `horror` movies directed by `Jordan Peele`:

```
genres = horror AND director = 'Jordan Peele'
```

#### `OR`

`OR` connects two conditions and returns results that satisfy at least one of them.

The following expression returns either `horror` or `comedy` films:

```
genres = horror OR genres = comedy
```

#### Creating filter expressions with strings

Meilisearch reads string expressions from left to right. You can use parentheses to ensure expressions are correctly parsed.

<Capsule intent="note">
Filtering on string values is case-insensitive.
</Capsule>

For instance, if you want your results to only include `comedy` and `horror` movies released after March 1995, the parentheses in the following query are mandatory:

```
(genres = horror OR genres = comedy) AND release_date > 795484800
```

Failing to add these parentheses will cause the same query to be parsed as:

```
genres = horror OR (genres = comedy AND release_date > 795484800)
```

Translated into English, the above expression will only return comedies released after March 1995 or horror movies regardless of their `release_date`.

<Capsule intent="note">
When creating an expression with a field name or value identical to a filter operator such as `AND` or `NOT`, you must wrap it in quotation marks: `title = "NOT" OR title = "AND"`.
</Capsule>

#### Creating filter expressions with arrays

Array expressions establish logical connectives by nesting arrays of strings. **Array filters can have a maximum depth of two**—expressions with three or more levels of nesting will throw an error.

Outer array elements are connected by an `AND` operator. The following expression returns `horror` movies directed by `Jordan Peele`:

```
["genres = horror", "director = 'Jordan Peele'"]
```

Inner array elements are connected by an `OR` operator. The following expression returns either `horror` or `comedy` films:

```
[["genres = horror", "genres = comedy"]]
```

Inner and outer arrays can be freely combined. The following expression returns both `horror` and `comedy` movies directed by `Jordan Peele`:

```
[["genres = horror", "genres = comedy"], "director = 'Jordan Peele'"]
```

#### Combining arrays and strings

You can also create filter expressions that use both array and string syntax.

The following filter is written as a string and only returns movies not directed by `Jordan Peele` that belong to the `comedy` or `horror` genres:

```
"(genres = comedy OR genres = horror) AND director != 'Jordan Peele'"
```

You can write the same filter mixing arrays and strings:

```
[["genres = comedy", "genres = horror"], "NOT director = 'Jordan Peele'"]
```

## Using filters

Suppose that your `movie_ratings` dataset contains several movies in the following format:

```json
[
  …
  {
    "id": 458723,
    "title": "Us",
    "director": "Jordan Peele",
    "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/ux2dU1jQ2ACIMShzB3yP93Udpzc.jpg",
    "overview": "Husband and wife Gabe and Adelaide Wilson take their…",
    "release_date": 1552521600,
    "genres": [
      "Comedy",
      "Horror",
      "Thriller"
    ],
    "rating": {
      "critics": 86,
      "users": 73
    },
  },
  …
]
```

<Capsule intent="warning">
[Synonyms](/learn/configuration/synonyms) don't apply to filters. Meaning, if you have `SF` and `San Francisco` set as synonyms, filtering by `SF` and `San Francisco` will show you different results.
</Capsule>

After adding `director`, `release_date`, and `genres` to the [`filterableAttributes` index setting](//reference/api/settings#filterable-attributes), you can use them for filtering.

The following code sample returns `Avengers` movies released after 18 March 1995:

<CodeSamples id="filtering_guide_1" />

You can also combine multiple conditions. For example, you can limit your search so it only includes `Batman` movies directed by either `Tim Burton` or `Christopher Nolan`:

<CodeSamples id="filtering_guide_2" />

Here, the parentheses are mandatory: without them, the filter would return movies directed by `Tim Burton` and released after 1995 or any film directed by `Christopher Nolan`, without constraints on its release date. This happens because `AND` takes precedence over `OR`.

If you only want recent `Planet of the Apes` movies that weren't directed by `Tim Burton`, you can use this filter:

<CodeSamples id="filtering_guide_3" />

`NOT director = "Tim Burton"` will include both documents that do not contain `"Tim Burton"` in its `director` field and documents without a `director` field. To return only documents that have a `director` field, expand the filter expression with the `EXISTS` operator:

```
release_date > 1577884550 AND (NOT director = "Tim Burton" AND director EXISTS)
```

### Filtering by geographic location

If your documents contain `_geo` data, you can filter results according to their geographic position using one of our built-in geosearch filter rules:

<CodeSamples id="geosearch_guide_filter_usage_1" />

[Read more about filtering results with `_geoRadius` and `_geoBoundingBox` in our geosearch guide.](/learn/fine_tuning_results/geosearch#filtering-results-with-_georadius-and-_geoboundingbox)

### Filtering by nested fields

Use dot notation to filter results based on a document's nested fields. The following query only returns thrillers with good user reviews:

<CodeSamples id="filtering_guide_nested_1" />

[You can read more about nested fields in our guide on data types.](/learn/advanced/datatypes)
