# Front-end integration

In the [quick start tutorial](/learn/getting_started/quick_start), you learned how to launch Meilisearch and make a search request. This article will teach you how to create a simple front-end interface to search through your dataset.

Using [`instant-meilisearch`](https://github.com/meilisearch/instant-meilisearch) is the easiest way to build a front-end interface for search. `instant-meilisearch` is a plugin that establishes communication between a Meilisearch instance and [InstantSearch](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js). InstantSearch, an open-source project developed by Algolia, renders all the components needed to start searching.

## Let's try it!

1. Create an empty file and name it `index.html`
2. Open it in a text editor like Notepad, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code
3. Copy-paste one of the code samples above—either vanilla JavaScript, Vue 2, or React— and save the file
4. Open `index.html` in your browser by double-clicking it in your folder

You should now have a working front-end search interface. [Consult `instant-meilisearch`'s documentation for more information on how to further customize your search interface.](https://github.com/meilisearch/instant-meilisearch)
