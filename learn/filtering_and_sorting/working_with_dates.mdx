In this guide, you will learn about Meilisearch's approach to date and time values, how to prepare your dataset for indexing, and how to chronologically sort and filter search results.

## Preparing your documents

To filter and sort search results chronologically, your documents must have at least one field containing either a [UNIX timestamp](https://kb.narrative.io/what-is-unix-time) or a date in a human readable format such as `"2025-01-13"`.

As an example, consider a database of video games. In this dataset, the release year is formatted as a timestamp:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "title": "Return of the Obra Dinn",
    "genre": "adventure",
    "release_timestamp": 1538949600
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "The Excavation of Hob's Barrow",
    "genre": "adventure",
    "release_timestamp": 1664316000
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Bayonetta 2",
    "genre": "action",
    "release_timestamp": 1411164000
  }
]
```

Once all documents in your dataset have a date field, [index your data](/reference/api/documents#add-or-replace-documents) as usual. The example below adds a <a id="downloadVideogames" href="/assets/datasets/videogames.json" download="videogames.json">videogame dataset</a> to a `games` index:

<CodeSamplesDateGuideIndex1 />

## Filtering by date

To filter search results based on their timestamp, add your document's timestamp field to the list of [`filterableAttributes`](/reference/api/settings#update-filterable-attributes):

<CodeSamplesDateGuideFilterableAttributes1 />

Once you have configured `filterableAttributes`, you can filter search results by date. The following query only returns games released between 2018 and 2022:

<CodeSamplesDateGuideFilter1 />

## Sorting by date

To sort search results chronologically, add your document's timestamp field to the list of [`sortableAttributes`](/reference/api/settings#update-sortable-attributes):

<CodeSamplesDateGuideSortableAttributes1 />

Once you have configured `sortableAttributes`, you can sort your search results based on their timestamp. The following query returns all games sorted from most recent to oldest:

<CodeSamplesDateGuideSort1 />
