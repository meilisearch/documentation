In this guide, you will learn about Meilisearch's approach to date and time values, how to prepare your dataset for indexing, and how to chronologically sort and filter search results.

## Preparing your documents

To filter and sort search results chronologically, your documents must have at least one numeric field containing a [UNIX timestamp](https://kb.narrative.io/what-is-unix-time).

As an example, consider a database of video games. In this dataset, the release year is formatted as a timestamp:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "title": "Return of the Obra Dinn",
    "genre": "adventure",
    "release_timestamp": 1538949600
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "The Excavation of Hob's Barrow",
    "genre": "adventure",
    "release_timestamp": 1664316000
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Bayonetta 2",
    "genre": "action",
    "release_timestamp": 1411164000
  }
]
```

If your date field is expressed in a format other than a numeric timestamp, like [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html), you must convert it before indexing it with Meilisearch.

Most programming languages have built-in tools to help you with this process. The JavaScript example below converts a game's release date, `"2018-10-18"`, to a numeric timestamp:

```js
let game = {
  "id": 0,
  "title": "Return of the Obra Dinn",
  "genre": "adventure",
  "release_date": "2018-10-18T00:00Z"
};

const timestampInMilliseconds = Date.parse(game.release_date); // Date.parse returns the timestamp in milliseconds
const timestamp = timestampInMilliseconds / 1000; // UNIX timestamps must be in seconds

game = {
  "id": 0,
  "title": "Return of the Obra Dinn",
  "genre": "adventure",
  "release_date": "2018-10-18T00:00Z",
  "release_timestamp": timestamp
};
```

<Tip>
When preparing your dataset, it can be useful to leave the original date and time fields in your documents intact. In the example above, we keep the `release_date` field because it is more readable than the raw `release_timestamp`.
</Tip>

After adding a numeric timestamp to all documents, [index your data](/reference/api/documents#add-or-replace-documents) as usual. The example below adds a <a id="downloadVideogames" href="/assets/datasets/videogames.json" download="videogames.json">videogame dataset</a> to a `games` index:

<CodeSamplesDateGuideIndex1 />

## Filtering by timestamp

To filter search results based on their timestamp, add your document's timestamp field to the list of [`filterableAttributes`](/reference/api/settings#update-filterable-attributes):

<CodeSamplesDateGuideFilterableAttributes1 />

Once you have configured `filterableAttributes`, you can filter search results by date. The following query only returns games released between 2018 and 2022:

<CodeSamplesDateGuideFilter1 />

## Sorting by timestamp

To sort search results chronologically, add your document's timestamp field to the list of [`sortableAttributes`](/reference/api/settings#update-sortable-attributes):

<CodeSamplesDateGuideSortableAttributes1 />

Once you have configured `sortableAttributes`, you can sort your search results based on their timestamp. The following query returns all games sorted from most recent to oldest:

<CodeSamplesDateGuideSort1 />
