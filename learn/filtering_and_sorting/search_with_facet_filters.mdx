# Search with facets

In Meilisearch, facets are a specialized type of filter. This guide shows you how to configure facets and use them when searching a database of books. It also gives you instruction on how to get

## Requirements

- a Meilisearch project
- a command-line terminal

## Configure facet index settings

First, create a new index using this <a id="downloadBooks" href="/assets/datasets/books.json" download="books.json">books dataset</a>. Documents in this dataset have the following fields:

```json
{
  "id": 5,
  "title": "Hard Times",
  "genres": ["Classics","Fiction", "Victorian", "Literature"],
  "publisher": "Penguin Classics",
  "language": "English",
  "author": "Charles Dickens",
  "description":"Hard Times is a novel of social […] ",
  "format": "Hardcover",
  "rating": 3
}
```

Next, add `genres`, `language`, and `rating` to the list of `filterableAttributes`:

<CodeSamples id="faceted_search_update_settings_1" />

You have now configured your index to use these attributes as filters.

## Use facets in a search query

Make a search query setting the `facets` search parameter:

<CodeSamples id="faceted_search_1" />

The response returns all books matching the query. It also returns two fields you can use to create a faceted search interface, `facetDistribution` and `facetStats`:

```json
{
  "hits":[
    …
  ],
  …
  "facetDistribution":{
    "genres":{
      "Classics":6,
      …
    },
    "language":{
      "English":6,
      "French":1,
      "Spanish":1
    },
    "rating":{
      "2.5":1,
      …
    }
  },
  "facetStats":{
    "rating":{
      "min":2.5,
      "max":4.7
    }
  }
}
```

`facetDistribution` lists all facets present in your search results, along with the number of documents returned for each facet.

`facetStats` contains the highest and lowest values for all facets containing numeric values.

### Sorting facet values

By default, all facet values are sorted in ascending alphanumeric order. You can change this using the `sortFacetValuesBy` property of the [`faceting` index settings](/reference/api/settings#faceting):

<CodeSamples id="facet_search_2" />

The above code sample sorts the `genres` facet by descending value count.

Repeating the previous query using the new settings will result in a different order in `facetsDistribution`:

```json
{
  …
  "facetDistribution": {
    "genres": {
      "Fiction": 8,
      "Literature": 7,
      "Classics": 6,
      "Novel": 2,
      "Horror": 2,
      "Fantasy": 2,
      "Victorian": 2,
      "Vampires": 1,
      "Tragedy": 1,
      "Satire": 1,
      "Romance": 1,
      "Historical Fiction": 1,
      "Coming-of-Age": 1,
      "Comedy": 1
    },
   …
   }
}
```

## Searching facet values

You can also search for facet values with the [facet search endpoint](/reference/api/facet_search):

<CodeSamples id="facet_search_3" />

The following code sample searches the `genres` facet for values starting with `c`:

The response contains a `facetHits` array listing all matching facets, together with the total number of documents that include that facet:

```json
{
  …
  "facetHits": [
    {
      "value": "Children's Literature",
      "count": 1
    },
    {
      "value": "Classics",
      "count": 6
    },
    {
      "value": "Comedy",
      "count": 2
    },
    {
      "value": "Coming-of-Age",
      "count": 1
    }
  ],
  "facetQuery": "c",
  …
}
```

You can further refine results using the `q`, `filter`, and `matchingStrategy` parameters. [Learn more about them in the API reference.](/reference/api/facet_search)
