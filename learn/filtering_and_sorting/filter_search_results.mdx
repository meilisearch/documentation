In this guide you will see how to configure and use Meilisearch filters in a hypothetical movie database.

## Configure index settings

Suppose you have a collection of movies called `movie_ratings` containing the following fields:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 458723,
    "title": "Us",
    "director": "Jordan Peele",
    "release_date": 1552521600,
    "genres": [
      "Thriller",
      "Horror",
      "Mystery"
    ],
    "rating": {
      "critics": 86,
      "users": 73
    },
  },
  …
]
```

If you want to filter results based on an attribute, you must first add it to the `filterableAttributes` list:

<CodeSamplesFilteringUpdateSettings1 />

**This step is mandatory and cannot be done at search time**. Updating `filterableAttributes` requires Meilisearch to re-index all your data, which will take an amount of time proportionate to your dataset size and complexity.

<Note>
By default, `filterableAttributes` is empty. Filters do not work without first explicitly adding attributes to the `filterableAttributes` list.
</Note>

## Use `filter` when searching

After updating the [`filterableAttributes` index setting](/reference/api/settings#filterable-attributes), you can use `filter` to fine-tune your search results.

`filter` is a search parameter you may use at search time. `filter` accepts [filter expressions](/learn/filtering_and_sorting/filter_expression_reference) built using any attributes present in the `filterableAttributes` list.

The following code sample returns `Avengers` movies released after 18 March 1995:

<CodeSamplesFilteringGuide1 />

Use dot notation to filter results based on a document's [nested fields](/learn/engine/datatypes). The following query only returns thrillers with good user reviews:

<CodeSamplesFilteringGuideNested1 />

You can also combine multiple conditions. For example, you can limit your search so it only includes `Batman` movies directed by either `Tim Burton` or `Christopher Nolan`:

<CodeSamplesFilteringGuide2 />

Here, the parentheses are mandatory: without them, the filter would return movies directed by `Tim Burton` and released after 1995 or any film directed by `Christopher Nolan`, without constraints on its release date. This happens because `AND` takes precedence over `OR`.

If you only want recent `Planet of the Apes` movies that weren't directed by `Tim Burton`, you can use this filter:

<CodeSamplesFilteringGuide3 />

```
release_date > 1577884550 AND (NOT director = "Tim Burton" AND director EXISTS)
```

<Warning>
[Synonyms](/learn/relevancy/synonyms) don't apply to filters. Meaning, if you have `SF` and `San Francisco` set as synonyms, filtering by `SF` and `San Francisco` will show you different results.
</Warning>
