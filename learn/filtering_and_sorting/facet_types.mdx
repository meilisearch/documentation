# Facet types

## Conjunctive facets

Conjunctive facets use the `AND` logical operator. When users select multiple values for a facet, returned results must contain all selected facet values.

With conjunctive facets, when a user selects `English` from the `language` facet, all returned books must be in English. If the user further narrows down the search by selecting `Fiction` and `Literature` as `genres`, all returned books must be in English and contain both `genres`.

```
"language = English AND genres = Fiction AND genres = Literature"
```

The GIF below shows how the facet count for `genres` updates to only include books that meet **all three conditions**.

## Disjunctive facets

Disjunctive facets use the `OR` logical operator. When users select multiple values for a facet, returned results must contain at least one of the selected values.

With disjunctive facets, when a user selects `Fiction`, and `Literature`, Meilisearch returns all books that are either `Fiction`, `Literature`, or both:

```
"genres = Fiction OR genres = Literature"
```

The GIF below shows the `books` dataset with disjunctive facets. Notice how the facet count for `genres` updates based on the selection.

### Combining conjunctive and disjunctive facets

It is possible to create search queries with both conjunctive and disjunctive facets.

For example, a user might select `English` and `French` from the `language` facet so they can see books written either in English or in French. This query uses an `OR` operator and is a disjunctive facet:

```
"language = English OR language = French"
```

The same user might also be interested in literary fiction books and select `Fiction` and `Literature` as `genres`. Since the user wants a specific combination of genres, their query uses an `AND` operator:

```
"genres = Fiction AND genres = Literature"
```

The user can combine these two filter expressions in one by wrapping them in parentheses and using an `AND` operator:

```
"(language = English OR language = French) AND (genres = Fiction AND genres = Literature)"
```

The GIF below shows the `books` dataset with conjunctive and disjunctive facets. Notice how the facet count for each facet updates based on the selection.
