Querying the [get tasks endpoint](/reference/api/tasks#get-tasks) returns all tasks that have not been deleted. This unfiltered list may be difficult to parse in large projects.

This guide shows you how to use query parameters to filter tasks and obtain a more readable list of asynchronous operations.

<Tip>
Filtering batches with [the `/batches` route](/reference/api/batches) follows the same rules as filtering tasks. Keep in mind that many `/batches` parameters such as `uids` target the tasks included in batches, instead of the batches themselves.
</Tip>

## Requirements

- a command-line terminal
- a running Meilisearch project

## Filtering tasks with a single parameter

Use the get tasks endpoint to fetch all `canceled` tasks:

<CodeSamplesAsyncGuideFilterByStatuses1 />

Use a comma to separate multiple values and fetch both `canceled` and `failed` tasks:

<CodeSamplesAsyncGuideFilterByStatuses2 />

You may filter tasks based on `uid`, `status`, `type`, `indexUid`, `canceledBy`, or date. Consult the API reference for a full list of task filtering parameters.

## Combining filters

Use the ampersand character (`&`) to combine filters, equivalent to a logical `AND`:

<CodeSamplesAsyncGuideMultipleFilters1 />

This code sample returns all tasks in the `movies` index that have the type `documentAdditionOrUpdate` or `documentDeletion` and have the `status` of `processing`.

<Warning>
**`OR` operations between different filters are not supported.** For example, you cannot view tasks which have a type of `documentAddition` **or** a status of `failed`.
</Warning>
